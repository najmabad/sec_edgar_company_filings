PORTIONS AMENDED

The  Registrant  hereby  amends  Part  II,  Items  7 and  8,  contained  in  the
Registrant's  Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended  September 30, 2000.
The  Registrant   originally  classified  the  5%  Preferred  Stock  outstanding
(discussed in Note 11, "Stockholders'  Equity") as permanent equity at September
30, 2000.  However,  as a result of a conversion price  adjustment,  shareholder
approval may be required in the future to authorize the listing and issuance of
additional  shares of common  stock needed to convert  outstanding  5% Preferred
Stock into common stock on July 31, 2002. Since such  shareholder  approval is a
contingency outside of the registrant's  control,  the 5% Preferred Stock is now
presented outside of permanent equity.

In  addition:  (a) the footnote  disclosure  regarding  the 5%  Preferred  Stock
included  in Note 11,  "Stockholders'  Equity,"  was  modified;  and (b) related
discussion  areas in the  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial
Condition and Operations" section were modified as necessary.

The referenced restatement of the fiscal 2000 financial statements had no affect
on the Company's net loss, total assets or total liabilities.

                        Report of Independent Accountants

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of General DataComm Industries, Inc.

In our  opinion,  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  related  consolidated
statements of operations and accumulated  deficit and cash flows present fairly,
in all  material  respects,  the  consolidated  financial  position  of  General
DataComm  Industries,  Inc. and Subsidiaries at September 30, 2000 and 1999, and
the  consolidated  results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended  September  30,  2000,  in  conformity  with
accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States. These financial
statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Corporation's   management;   our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based upon
our audits.  We conducted  our audits of these  statements  in  accordance  with
auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the United States.  Those  standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about
whether the financial  statements  are free of material  misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion expressed above.

The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been  prepared  assuming that the
Company  will  continue  as a  going  concern.  As  discussed  in  Note 1 to the
financial  statements,  the  Company  has  suffered  recurring  losses  and cash
deficits  from  operations  that raise  substantial  doubt  about its ability to
continue as a going concern.  Management's  plans in regard to these matters are
also  described in Note 1, and are dependent  upon,  among other things,  future
profitable  operations,  the ability to generate sufficient cash from operations
and to obtain  additional  financing  sources.  The financial  statements do not
include  any   adjustments   that  might   result  from  the  outcome  of  these
uncertainties.

As discussed in Note 18 to the financial statements, the presentation of certain
preferred  stock  amounts  included in  permanent  equity has been  reversed and
presented as mandatorily  redeemable  preferred  stock in the September 30, 2000
financial statements.

                     Management's Discussion and Analysis of
                  Results of Operations and Financial Condition

Business Conditions and Financial Plans

The  Company's   independent  auditors  have  expressed  uncertainty  about  the
Company's  ability  to  continue  as a going  concern  in their  opinion  on the
Company's  financial  statements.  On  January 5, 2001,  the  Company's  primary
lenders served the Company with a notice of default under the Company's loan and
security agreement ("Loan Agreement") as a result of the Company's  inability to
provide such lenders with Company financial statements supported by an qualified
opinion.  While such lenders have not  terminated  the revolving  line of credit
portion of the Loan Agreement,  pursuant to which advances are still continuing,
the lenders have  reserved  their right to declare such advances due and payable
and/or limit the amount of such future advances, and have increased the interest
rates on such advances and the outstanding term loans. There can be no assurance
that the  lenders  will  continue  to make such  advances  or that they will not
accelerate the maturity of amounts due under the Loan Agreement. Acceleration of
such amounts may in turn result in the  acceleration of maturity of debt owed to
other creditors.

Since the Company does not currently have any  alternative  sources of operating
funds,  these matters  raise  substantial  doubt about the Company's  ability to
continue as a going concern.  Reference is made to Note 1, "Business  Conditions
and Financial Plans," for more detailed discussions, including risks and Company
plans.

Summary Highlights

The  company  did not  achieve  the  revenue  growth  in  fiscal  2000  that was
anticipated  after the  reorganization  into business  units in fiscal 1999. The
lower total  revenues  ($3.9 million)  occurred  primarily in product  revenues,
which  declined  $3.2  million,  or 2.7%.  Most of this decline is the result of
lower broadband product sales which is discussed below.

In an effort to compensate for the reduced product revenues,  operating expenses
for the  fiscal  year were  reduced  by $7.4  million,  or 8.5%.  The  resulting
operating  loss was $24.6  million,  or $0.9 million worse than the prior fiscal
year.

Net cash consumed in operating and investing  activities  totaled $27.6 million.
To fund  these  activities  and pay other  debt and  dividend  obligations,  the
Company secured a term loan of $20 million and, in private transactions,  issued
common stock for $15 million and redeemable  preferred stock for $5 million.  Of
the common  stock  proceeds,  $5.3  million is targeted to redeem the  preferred
stock in the  future  under  the  terms  of the  agreement  with  the  preferred
stockholders.

At September  30, 2000,  the Company had $3.6 million in cash and the ability to
borrow  $15.6  million  under a  revolving  credit  line  ($5.3  million of such
revolving  credit  line  is  being  reserved  for  potential  redemption  of the
Company's 5%  redeemable  preferred  stock in January  2001).  In  addition,  in
October 2000 the Company  settled a lawsuit for proceeds of $5.5 million (before
expenses).  However,  the Company does not currently  have  sufficient  funds to
sustain  operations  for an extended  period.  In order to obtain such funds the
Company will be required to sell  additional  stock,  take on additional debt or
sell assets,  such as a division.  The Company is actively  pursuing  additional
sources of financing.  In addition,  the Company is  restructuring  its business
units to generate operational  efficiencies  targeted to result in positive cash
flows.  Although  the  Company  has  historically  been able to satisfy its cash
requirements,  there can be no assurance that such efforts to obtain  sufficient
financing for operations will be successful in the future.

Summary  financial  results by business  unit for fiscal  2000,  fiscal 1999 and
fiscal 1998, along with a reconciliation to reported net loss, are as follows:

The  Broadband  Systems  Division  continues to generate  significant  operating
losses due to the high level of  research  and  development  spending to support
both  new  product  development  and  product  enhancements.   (See  "Multimedia
Division"  below  for  discussion  of video  products  developed  by BSD.)  Also
supported is a worldwide sales and marketing organization.

Broadband Systems Division ("BSD")

Fiscal 2000 vs. Fiscal 1999: BSD revenues were  disappointing in the second half
of the fiscal year and this  contributed to annual  revenues being lower by $3.5
million,  or 5.9% from the prior year.  Most ($2.4  million)  of this  reduction
results  from  lower  sales of the  division's  legacy  TDM  products  as demand
migrates to newer  technologies.  The  division  also  witnessed a reduction  of
shipments  into  its  established  customer  carrier  base  in  Europe  due to a
reduction in expansion of networks  requiring BSD  equipment,  and into the CLEC
(competitive  local exchange  carrier)  market,  which was affected by a general
economic  slowdown.  Also limiting  BSD's revenue growth was the bankruptcy of a
major customer in May 2000.

Despite  the  lower  revenue,  BSD was  still  able to  achieve  a $3.0  million
reduction in its annual operating loss by streamlining operations and refocusing
its research and development activities.

Fiscal 1999 vs. Fiscal 1998:  BSD's  operating loss amounted to $(29.4)  million
and $(25.7) million in fiscal 1999 and 1998, respectively, an increase of $(3.7)
million.  Revenue amounted to $59.1 million and $82.6 million in fiscal 1999 and
1998, respectively,  a reduction of $(23.5) million, or 28.5%. The reduction was
comprised of a $(16.1)  million  reduction  in legacy TDM product  revenue and a
$(7.4) million reduction in ATM product revenue.  Geographically,  most (68%) of
the  revenue  decline  occurred  in Central  America,  Latin  America  and Asia,
primarily  attributable to technology changes and difficult economic  conditions
experienced  in  those  regions.  BSD's  legacy  TDM  product  line  experienced
significant revenue declines in both fiscal 1999 and 1998.

The December 1998 reorganization resulted in a $9.1 million, or 13.2%, reduction
in BSD operating  expenses for fiscal 1999.  This cost reduction  offset all but
$3.7 million of the impact of the revenue loss referenced above.

Network Access Division ("NAD")

Fiscal 2000 vs. Fiscal 1999:  NAD revenues were modestly  lower  year-over-year,
primarily related to a shortfall in materials  availability in the fourth fiscal
quarter.  Parts shortages at an outsource contract  manufacturer  affected NAD's
ability to fulfill orders in the fourth  quarter.  Another part of the shortfall
was from  business with Verizon  where there was  interruption  in normal buying
patterns which we believe may have resulted from the Verizon employee strike and
the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE (to form Verizon).

NAD showed an operating profit for the fiscal year of $2.6 million,  an increase
from $1.7 million in the prior fiscal year due to operating cost reductions.

                                       3
<PAGE>

Fiscal 1999 vs. Fiscal 1998: NAD's fiscal 1999 operating income amounted to $1.7
million as  compared  to an  operating  loss of $(1.4)  million in fiscal  1998,
reflecting an  improvement  of $3.1 million.  The  improvement  reflects the net
effect of reduced  revenues  (NAD  revenue  amounted to $59.9  million and $65.9
million in fiscal 1999 and 1998,  respectively)  and a $6.9  million,  or 20.5%,
reduction in operating expenses.

The fiscal 1999 revenue  decline is principally  attributable  to lower sales of
legacy analog  products to domestic  telephone  companies.  Internationally,  an
increase in business in the Canadian  marketplace  (growth of $5.3  million) was
offset  with a decline in business in Central  America,  Latin  America and Asia
(down $5.5  million).  The reduction in NAD's  operating  expenses  reflects the
impact  of the  Company's  restructuring  into  independent  business  units  in
December 1998. Refer to Note 3, "Restructuring of Operations and Other Charges,"
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed discussion of the
charges.

VITAL Network Services L.L.C. ("VITAL")

Fiscal 2000 vs. Fiscal 1999: VITAL revenues  improved $2.1 million,  or 4.6%, in
fiscal year 2000 over fiscal year 1999. Fiscal fourth quarter revenues reached a
new record level at $13.2  million.  The "Y2K"  lockdown of  communications  and
computer networks slowed service business earlier in the year. However, revenues
grew 16.2% in the second half over the first half of the fiscal year.

VITAL has been on a mission to grow  revenues  through  new  relationships  with
equipment providers apart from General DataComm. Such clients accounted for over
45% of VITAL's  total  revenues  in fiscal  2000 and  reached  48% in the fourth
fiscal quarter. This compares to 30% in fiscal 1999.

VITAL operating income was $2.9 million in fiscal 2000, compared to $5.9 million
in fiscal 1999. The reduction was  attributable to investments  made in business
infrastructure, including computer systems, expansion of the sales organization,
as well as other  strategic  investments.  Operating  income was also negatively
impacted by the  slowdown in business in the first half of the fiscal  year,  as
mentioned  above,  and the decision to retain full  operating  staff during this
period in anticipation of revenue opportunities later in the fiscal year.

Fiscal 1999 vs.  Fiscal 1998:  VITAL's  revenue  increased by $8.8  million,  or
23.3%, in fiscal 1999.  Operating income amounted to $5.9 million,  or 12.6%, of
revenue in fiscal  1999 as  compared to $3.3  million,  or 8.7% of  revenue,  in
fiscal 1998.  Independent  third-party  customers  accounted  for all of VITAL's
revenue  growth;  revenue from services  provided to GDC  customers  declined in
fiscal 1999.  Gross margin rates were  relatively  consistent  with fiscal 1998;
operating  expenses were up $0.6 million or 7.2%,  reflecting  increased selling
cost. The revenue growth,  consistent  gross margin rates and operating  expense
growth  resulted in a $2.6 million,  or 78%,  increase in fiscal 1999  operating
income.

Multimedia Division ("MMD")

MMD has established itself with award-winning,  state-of-the-art  video products
which the Company  believes  represent  excellent  future  potential  and should
generate significant revenue growth in fiscal 2001 and beyond.

The costs to  develop  these  products  ($3.1  million  in fiscal  2000 and $2.3
million in fiscal 1999) have been  historically  shown as part of the  Broadband
Systems Division. Separate financials will be presented for MMD beginning in the
2001 first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2000.

Other Revenues

Fiscal 2000 "other  revenues"  consist of revenues  from the  Company's  leasing
subsidiary,  DataComm Leasing Corporation ("DLC"),  which provides  creditworthy
customers  with the option of leasing the Company's  products under a variety of
programs.  DLC's  revenues were $3.4  million,  $4.2 million and $4.4 million in
fiscal  2000,  1999 and 1998,  respectively.  DLC's  operating  income  was $2.3
million,  $3.2  million  and  $3.1  million  in  fiscal  2000,  1999  and  1998,
respectively.

Fiscal  1999 and 1998  "other  revenues"  also  included  $1.1  million  and 3.2
million,  respectively, of revenues generated from a division sold during fiscal
1999. Operating income of this division approximated breakeven in each year.

Reconciliation to Net Loss

Corporate  expenses:  Such  expenses are comprised of executive  management  and
staff  support  positions  and include  such items as legal and audit  fees,  in
addition to compensation  costs. The increase in expenses in fiscal 2000 was due
to  increases  in  outside  service  fees in  addition  to  normal  compensation
increases.

Interest expense,  net:  Interest expense,  net increased $1.7 million in fiscal
2000 and $1.1  million  in fiscal  1999,  reflecting  higher  levels of debt and
higher interest rates associated with more recent financings.

Other, net:  "Other, net" is comprised of the following:

"Restructuring  charges"  are  comprised  of  severance  costs  associated  with
announced  employee  termination  actions.  The primary  components  of "charges
related to a customer bankruptcy" are uncollectible receivable write-offs, costs
incurred to reclaim inventory and legal fees. "Debt conversion  expense" relates
to non-cash charges representing the value of incremental shares of common stock
issued  to  retire  convertible  debt.  As a result,  stockholders'  equity  was
increased  and debt was decreased by  approximately  $22 million in fiscal 2000.
"Gain on sale of a  division"  relates to the sale of the  Company's  Technology
Alliance Group ("TAG") in fiscal 1999.  "Operating  income from a division sold"
in fiscal 1999 is comprised of operating  income generated from TAG prior to the
sale.

See the Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements for further descriptions of
the items described above that are included in "Other, net."

Income taxes: For information  concerning the provisions for income taxes, which
generally  represent  provisions  for foreign  income taxes and  domestic  state
taxes,  refer to Note 9, "Income Taxes," of the Notes to Consolidated  Financial
Statements.   The  Company  has   significant   domestic  net   operating   loss
carryforwards  (approximately $195 million at September 30, 2000) and tax credit
carryforwards  (approximately  $14.5 million at September 30, 2000) available to
reduce future U.S.  federal income taxes.  The net operating loss  carryforwards
begin to expire in the year 2004.

Market Risk

The  Company is exposed to various  market  risks,  including  potential  losses
arising  from  adverse  changes  in market  rates and  prices  (such as  foreign
currency exchange and interest rates), dependence upon a limited number of major
product  distributors  and  resellers and  dependence  upon  outsource  contract
manufacturers.  The  Company  historically  has not  entered  into  derivatives,
forward   exchange   contacts  or  other  financial   instruments  for  trading,
speculation or hedging purposes.

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company's foreign  subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency  fluctuation
since they are invoicing  customers in local  currencies  while  liabilities for
product  purchases from the parent Company are transacted in U.S.  dollars.  The
impact  of  foreign  currency  fluctuations  on  these  U.S.  dollar-denominated
liabilities  is  recorded as a component  of "Other  Income and  Expense" in the
Company's  consolidated  statements of  operations  and resulted in net currency
exchange  gains or (losses) of $643,000,  $66,000 and $(400,000) in fiscal 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively.

                                       5
<PAGE>

No individual  foreign  subsidiary  comprises 10 percent or more of consolidated
revenue or assets, and most subsidiary  operations represent less than 5 percent
of consolidated revenue or assets.  Therefore,  the Company historically has not
entered into hedge  contracts or any form of derivative  or similar  investment.
Separately, the introduction of the Euro as a common currency for members of the
European Monetary Union,  which occurred during fiscal 1999, has not had, and is
not in the future expected to have, a significant  impact the Company's exposure
to foreign currency transactions.

Reference is made to Note 2,  sub-caption  "Foreign  Currency,"  of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Interest Risk

The fair  market  value of  long-term  fixed  interest-rate  debt is  subject to
interest-rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest-rate debt
will increase as interest  rates fall and decrease as interest  rates rise.  The
estimated fair value of the Company's total  long-term debt  (including  current
portion)  approximated  $55.2  million at September  30, 2000,  as compared to a
recorded value of $55.0 million.  The Company  estimates that a 1% increase from
prevailing  interest  rates at September 30, 2000 would reduce the fair value of
total  long-term  debt by  approximately  $60,000.  See  Note 2 to the  Notes to
Consolidated   Financial  Statements  under  the  sub-caption  "Fair  Values  of
Financial Instruments" for further discussion.

Financial Condition and Liquidity

The  Company's   independent  auditors  have  expressed  uncertainty  about  the
Company's  ability  to  continue  as a going  concern  in their  opinion  on the
Company's  financial  statements.  On  January 5, 2001,  the  Company's  primary
lenders  served the Company with a notice of default  under the  Company's  Loan
Agreement  as a result of the Company's  inability  to provide such lenders with
Company financial  statements  supported by an unqualified  opinion.  While such
lenders have not  terminated  the revolving  line of credit  portion of the Loan
Agreement,  pursuant to which  advances are still  continuing,  the lenders have
reserved  their right to declare such advances due and payable  and/or limit the
amount of such future  advances,  and have  increased the interest rates on such
advances and the  outstanding  term loans.  There can be no  assurance  that the
lenders will continue to make such advances or that they will not accelerate the
maturity of amounts due under the Loan  Agreement.  Acceleration of such amounts
may in turn  result  in the  acceleration  of  maturity  of debt  owed to  other
creditors.

Since the Company does not currently have any  alternative  sources of operating
funds,  these matters  raise  substantial  doubt about the Company's  ability to
continue as a going concern.  Reference is made to Note 1, "Business  Conditions
and Financial Plans," for more detailed discussions, including risks and Company
plans.

Subject to the  above-referenced  risks, future cash requirements are planned to
be satisfied  from a combination of cash balances ($3.6 million at September 30,
2000),  additional  borrowings  available under the Company's  revolving line of
credit and, subject to  availability,  other funds resulting from new borrowings
and/or the sale of assets and/or securities.  In addition,  in October 2000, the
Company  settled  a  lawsuit  and  received  proceeds  of $5.5  million  (before
expenses).  Based upon the  provisions of the Company's  Loan  Agreement,  $15.8
million of  additional  funds were  available to borrow at  September  30, 2000;
however,  $5.3 million of such funds were reserved for  potential  redemption of
the Company's  outstanding  redeemable  5% preferred  stock on January 31, 2001.
Details of the  Company's  primary loan and security  agreement are described in
Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Based on current projections, the Company will require, in addition to continued
access to its existing  Loan  Agreement  and related  revolving  line of credit,
additional  funds early in the second  fiscal  quarter  ending March 31, 2001 in
order to sustain future  operations.  In order to obtain such funds, the Company
will be  required  to sell  additional  stock,  secure  additional  debt or sell
assets, such as a division.

In anticipation of the requirement to obtain  additional funds, in June 2000 the
Company  engaged CIBC World  Markets to provide  strategic  direction  which may
involve  the sale of a  division  or the total  Company.  Although  to date this
initiative has not been successful in providing  additional  funds,  the Company
continues to actively pursue  opportunities  that are presented and is currently
engaged in such discussions.

Furthermore,  the Company has plans to further restructure its business to focus
on  revised  product  development   strategies,   and  to  generate  operational
efficiencies and reduced overheads targeted to result in positive cash flows. As
part  of  this  program,   on  November  17,  2000,  the  Company   announced  a
restructuring  that  involved a reduction  in  headcount  of  approximately  100
persons,  or 10% of the  workforce.  Additional  actions were  effected in early
January  2001.  However,  even with  such  actions,  the  Company  will  require
additional cash funds.

Reference is made to Note 8 to the Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
for  discussions  regarding the Company's  Loan  Agreement and all other Company
indebtedness outstanding.

The Company is actively pursuing all additional  sources of financing.  Although
the Company has historically been able to satisfy its cash  requirements,  there
can be no  assurance  that such  efforts  to  obtain  sufficient  financing  for
operations  will be successful in the future,  or successful on terms that would
be considered beneficial to the Company and its shareholders.  Reference is made
to  Note 1 of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  further
discussion of business conditions and the Company's financial plans.

Operating

Net cash used in operating  activities amounted to $8.9 million and $1.6 million
in fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Non-debt working capital,  excluding cash and cash equivalents,  decreased  to
$18.7  million at September  30, 2000 as compared to $23.5  million at September
30, 1999. The $4.8 million reduction is principally comprised of a $7.2 million
reduction in accounts receivable, a $4.4 million increase in trade accounts
payable, and $2.6 million of other working capital reductions (mostly leasing
assets due to existing leases reaching maturity or being canceled), offset
by an increase in inventories of $9.4 million.

The increase in inventories  reflects the effect of lower product shipments than
anticipated,  in part due to the cancellation of a large order due to a customer
bankruptcy,  and the  impact  of  difficulties  experienced  with the  Company's
primary  outsourcing   supplier,   which  required  the  Company  to  invest  in
inventories  to assure  continuity of shipments to  customers.  The reduction in
accounts  receivable reflects lower sales levels in the current fiscal year. The
increase in accounts  payable  reflects  amounts  owed for the higher  inventory
levels being carried.

Investing

The  Company  continued  to  invest  in new  technologies  during  fiscal  2000.
Investments in property,  plant and equipment amounted to $6.2 million in fiscal
2000  compared  to $7.5  million  in fiscal  1999.  Investments  in  capitalized
software remained consistent, amounting to $12.5 million in both fiscal 2000 and
1999.  All  investment  activity  was  targeted  to  satisfy  minimum  operating
requirements  and to  embrace  new  undertakings  with  the  greatest  potential
returns.

During fiscal 1999, the Company generated $15.1 million in net proceeds from the
sale of a non-strategic  division ($12.0 million) and manufacturing assets ($3.1
million) as part of a manufacturing  outsourcing  program.  Reference is made to
Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Financing

Net cash  provided by financing  activities  amounted to $27.5 million in fiscal
2000.  The  principal  sources of funds were from the addition of $20 million in
term loan debt and $1.0 million of capital equipment financing, the sales of $15
million of common stock and $5 million of redeemable preferred stock in separate
private transactions, and monies collected from employees under stock option and
stock purchase plans. The net proceeds from these  transactions  ($41.8 million)
were used to fund the operating and investing  activities  (described above), to
reduce  the  revolving  credit  loan by $8.2  million,  to make $4.8  million in
principal payments on debt and to pay $1.3 million in preferred stock dividends.
Preferred  stock  dividends  were  suspended  after the June 30, 2000  quarterly
payment was made to conserve cash for operating  purposes.  Net cash provided by
financing activities for fiscal 1999 amounted to $6.6 million, comprised of $7.7
million in net borrowings  and $0.7 million of proceeds  received for stock sold
under the Company's  employee stock purchase  plan,  partially  offset with $1.8
million in preferred stock dividends.

During the fiscal year ended  September  30,  2000,  $22.0  million of the $25.0
million in convertible 7-3/4% debentures  outstanding at September 30, 1999 were
converted into and exchanged for common stock, thereby reducing indebtedness and
increasing stockholders' equity.

Reference is made to Note 8 of the Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
for  discussion  regarding  the  Company's  Loan  Agreement,   as  amended,  the
conversion of the convertible  7-3/4%  debentures and other  indebtedness of the
Company.

Operating Lease Obligations

See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements for discussion of
the Company's operating lease obligations.

Concentrations of Credit

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of cash instruments and accounts receivable. The
Company places its cash investments  with  high-quality  financial  institutions
within the United States.

Approximately  $9.8  million,  or 32% of  consolidated  accounts  receivable  at
September  30, 2000  ($15.5  million,  or 41%,  at  September  30,  1999),  were
concentrated  in  telephone  companies  in  North  America  and  Europe.   These
receivables  are not  collateralized  due to the  high  credit  ratings  and the
extensive financial resources available to such telephone companies.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices

In  management's  opinion,  the impact of inflation and changing  prices for the
three most recent fiscal years is not significant to the financial statements as
reported.

Future Adoption of New Accounting Statements

Newly issued  pronouncements to become effective in fiscal 2001 or later are not
currently expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position
or  results of  operations.  Refer to Note 2,  "Future  Adoption  of  Accounting
Statements,"  of the Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  further
detailed information.

Certain Risk Factors

Continuing  Losses:  The Company has sustained net losses for the past 24
quarters  ended  September  30,  2000.  There can be no assurance as to when the
Company will achieve net income.

Credit  Availability:  As noted above, the Company's  independent  auditors have
expressed uncertainty about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern
in their opinion of the Company's financial statements.  On January 5, 2001, the
Company's primary lenders served the Company a notice of default under the under
the Company's Loan  Agreement as a result of the Company's  inability to provide
such lenders  with  Company  financial  statements  supported by an  unqualified
opinion.  Amounts outstanding under the Loan Agreement amounted to $40.7 million
at  September  30, 2000.  Separately,  the  Company's  Loan  Agreement  requires
compliance with specific  financial  covenants,  including the requirement  that
reported stockholders' equity, as defined, equals or exceeds $10.0 million (such
stockholders'  equity,  as defined,  amounted to $23.0  million at September 30,
2000).

While such lenders have not  terminated  the revolving line of credit portion of
the Loan Agreement, pursuant to which advances are still continuing, the lenders
have reserved  their right to declare such advances due and payable and/or limit
the amount of such future  advances,  and have  increased the interest  rates on
such advances and the outstanding term loans. There can be no assurance that the
lenders will continue to make such advances or that they will not accelerate the
maturity of amounts due under the Loan  Agreement.  Acceleration of such amounts
may in turn  result  in the  acceleration  of  maturity  of debt  owed to  other
creditors.

These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as
a going concern. Should the lenders lenders take further action, the Company may
be unable to borrow funds under such  agreement.  In such case the Company would
be required to seek other financing to fund its operations,  and there can be no
assurance the Company will be

                                       8
<PAGE>

able to obtain such financing or, if obtained,  on terms deemed favorable by the
Company. Reference is made to Note 1, "Business Conditions and Financial Plans,"
for more detailed discussions, including risks and Company plans.

Reliance on Outsourced  Manufacturing:  During fiscal 1999 and 2000, the Company
outsourced  substantially all of its manufacturing  operations.  Therefore,  the
Company is largely  dependent on third-party  suppliers to meet product delivery
deadlines and quality  requirements.  Any shortfall in the satisfaction of these
requirements  could negatively impact revenue and profitability in that quarter,
and possibly thereafter.  The Company's weakening financial position,  including
the above-referenced  notice of default from the Company's primary lenders, also
poses a risk that such manufacturing  outsource suppliers could become unwilling
to continue doing business with the Company.

Volatility of Stock Price:  The trading price of the Company's  Common Stock has
fluctuated  widely  in  response  to,  among  other  things,  quarter-to-quarter
operating results and financial position, industry conditions,  awards of orders
to  the  Company  or  its  competitors,   new  product  or  product  development
announcements by the Company or its competitors,  changes in earnings  estimates
by analysts and, from time to time, the volatile nature of equity  markets.  Any
shortfall in revenue or earnings  from  expected  levels could have an immediate
and  significant  adverse  effect on the trading price of the  Company's  Common
Stock in any given period.

Portions of the  foregoing  discussion  include  descriptions  of the  Company's
expectations regarding future trends affecting its business. The forward-looking
statements  made in this  annual  report,  as well as all other  forward-looking
statements  or  information  provided by the Company or its  employees,  whether
written or oral,  are made in reliance  upon the safe harbor  provisions  of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements and
future  results  are  subject  to, and should be  considered  in light of risks,
uncertainties,  and other factors which may affect future results including, but
not limited to, competition, rapid changing technology, regulatory requirements,

No cash dividends  have ever been paid on the Company's  common stock or Class B
stock.  The Company's  principal  loan  agreement does not allow payment of cash
dividends,  with the exception of cash  dividends  authorized for payment on the
Company's  9%  preferred  stock.  In the event  this would  change,  it is still
management's  intention to reinvest  future  earnings in the business to support
growth plans.

The Company had  approximately  1,525  shareholders  of record at September  30,
2000.

               General DataComm Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


1.   Business Conditions and Financial Plans

The Company has experienced recurring net losses of $36.9 million, $22.6 million
and $33.4  million  during the years ended  September  30, 2000,  1999 and 1998,
respectively. Operating and investing activities resulted in cash consumption of
$27.6,  $6.5, and $20.5 million for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. In addition, as a result of lower shipments resulting from a
general economic and industry  slowdown,  technology  changes and other factors,
and high investments in product development,  the Company may continue to suffer
significant  net losses and a negative  cash flow from  operations.  Payments of
preferred  stock  dividends  were  suspended  after the June 30, 2000  quarterly
payment was made.

In addition, the independent auditors for the Company have expressed uncertainty
about the  Company's  ability to continue as a going concern in their opinion on
the Company's  financial  statements.  On January 5, 2001, the Company's primary
lenders  served the Company with a notice of default  under the  Company's  Loan
Agreement  as a result of the  Company's  inability to provide such lenders with
Company financial  statements  supported by an unqualified  opinion.  While such
lenders have not  terminated  the revolving  line of credit  portion of the Loan
Agreement,  pursuant to which  advances are still  continuing,  the lenders have
reserved  their right to declare such advances due and payable  and/or limit the
amount of such future  advances,  and have  increased the interest rates on such
advances and the  outstanding  term loans.  There can be no  assurance  that the
lenders will continue to make such advances or that they will not accelerate the
maturity of amounts due under the Loan  Agreement.  Acceleration of such amounts
may in turn  result  in the  acceleration  of  maturity  of debt  owed to  other
creditors.

Since the Company  does not  currently  have any  alternative  sources of funds,
these matters raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as
a going  concern.  The Company's  continued  existence is dependent upon several
factors, including the Company's ability to increase revenue levels, restructure
operations to generate  positive cash flows,  retain access to its existing Loan
Agreement  and to  obtain  additional  financing.  Potential  financing  sources
include the sale of assets,  technologies,  existing  businesses,  the Company's
common and  preferred  stock and the  issuance of  additional  debt  securities.
Although   the  Company  has   historically   been  able  to  satisfy  its  cash
requirements,  there can be no assurance that such efforts to obtain  sufficient
financing for  operations  will be successful  in the future.  Furthermore,  the
Company could violate  covenant or default  provisions of other debt  agreements
during  fiscal 2001,  which could  accelerate  the maturity of amounts due under
such agreements.

In  response  to  current  conditions  and as a part  of its  ongoing  corporate
strategy,  the  Company is  pursuing  several  initiatives  intended to increase
liquidity  and better  position  the  Company to compete  under  current  market
conditions. Several completed and ongoing initiatives are summarized below.

In January 1998,  the Company  restructured  operations  to provide  operational
efficiencies. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 1998, selling, general and
administrative  expenses were reduced by $12.1 million, or 14%, and research and
product  development  expenses  were reduced by $8.9  million,  or 22%, from the
prior fiscal year.

In December 1998 (fiscal 1999), the Company was reorganized into three strategic
business  units to focus on  specific  product  and  service  strategies  and to
streamline  operations.  As a result,  for the fiscal year ended  September  30,
1999, selling, general and administrative expenses were further reduced by $13.4
million,  or 18%,  and research and product  development  expenses  were reduced
another $5.4 million, or 17%, from the prior fiscal year.

The  streamlining and aggressive cost reduction  programs  continued into fiscal
2000, where such expenses were further reduced in total another $7.4 million, or
8.5%. In addition,  the Company  initiated a program to outsource  manufacturing
operations.

Over the last three fiscal  years,  the  Company's  headcount was reduced by 731
persons, representing a workforce reduction of 42%.


                                       13
<PAGE>

Furthermore,  since  September  30, 2000,  the Company has announced a workforce
reduction of approximately  100 persons,  or 10% of the existing  headcount.  In
addition, the Company is in the process of preparing a strategic
reorganization  plan targeted at achieving  profitability and positive cash flow
in the  aftermath  of its  implementation,  including  a targeted  (incremental)
workforce reduction of approximately 200 persons in January 2001.

In addition to the restructuring and cost reduction actions taken, in June 2000,
the Company engaged CIBC World Markets to provide strategic direction, which may
ultimately involve the sale of one or more business units or the entire Company.
To  date  this  initiative  has  not  been  successful  in  identifying   viable
opportunities.  However,  the Company continues to actively pursue opportunities
that are presented and is aggressively looking to identify new opportunities.

While the Company is aggressively pursuing opportunities and corrective actions,
as  discussed  above,  there  can be no  assurance  that  the  Company  will  be
successful  in its efforts to achieve  future  profitable  operations,  generate
sufficient  cash  from  operations  and  obtain   additional   funding  sources.
Separately,   the  financial  statements,  as  presented,  do  not  include  any
adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

2.   Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

The   Company   is  a   worldwide   provider   of  wide  area   networking   and
telecommunications  products  and  services.  The  Company  designs,  assembles,
markets,   installs   and   maintains   products   and   services   that  enable
telecommunications  common  carriers,  corporations  and  governments  to build,
upgrade and better manage their global  telecommunications  networks.  In fiscal
1999 the Company commenced  operating in three business segments:  the Broadband
Systems  Division  ("BSD"),  which designs and sells packet  voice/data  gateway
products   including  ATM   (asynchronous   transfer  mode)  and   time-division
multiplexing  equipment;  the Network Access Division ("NAD"), which designs and
sells frame relay and DSL/UAS based products; and VITAL Network Services, L.L.C.
("VITAL"),  which provides a full range of professional and traditional  support
services worldwide for the networking  industry.  Refer to Note 12, "Segment and
Geographical  Information,"  for further  discussion  and a summary of financial
performance by operating segment.  In addition,  during fiscal 2000, the Company
launched the Multimedia  Division ("MMD"),  which supplies  award-winning  video
products for IP and ATM networks.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of the Company and
its majority-owned subsidiary companies. Intercompany accounts, transactions and
profits have been appropriately eliminated in consolidation.

Inventories

Inventories  are  stated  at the  lower  of cost  or  market  using a  first-in,
first-out method.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property,  plant and equipment are stated at cost and  depreciated  or amortized
using the  straight-line  method over their estimated  useful lives. The cost of
internally  constructed  assets (test fixtures)  includes the cost of materials,
internal labor and overhead costs.

Capitalized Software Development Costs

Software  development costs are capitalized for those products that have met the
requirements of  technological  feasibility.  Such costs are amortized using the
straight-line method, on a product-by-product basis, over the estimated economic
life of the product.  Unamortized costs are reviewed for recoverability  and, if
necessary,  adjusted so as not to exceed  estimated net  realizable  value.  All
capitalized software costs are written off when they become fully amortized. The
accumulated  amortization of capitalized  software development costs amounted to
$15,630,000 and $18,065,000 at September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

                                       14
<PAGE>

Goodwill

Goodwill is amortized  to expense on a  straight-line  basis over the  estimated
useful life of the goodwill,  generally  between 6 and 15 years.  The valuation,
recoverability  and amortization of goodwill is reviewed on a ongoing basis.

The  remaining  unamortized  portion of goodwill  (included in the  Consolidated
Balance  Sheets under "Other  assets")  amounted to $5,383,000 and $4,985,000 at
September  30, 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  The  accumulated  amortization  of
goodwill  amounted to $3,819,000  and $3,267,000 at September 30, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue from the sale of product is generally recognized at the date of shipment
unless the terms and conditions of the sale dictate recognition at a later date.
Service  revenue is either  recognized  when the service is performed or, in the
case of maintenance  contracts,  on a  straight-line  basis over the term of the
contract.   Technology  licensing  fee  revenue  (primarily  applicable  to  the
Company's  Technology  Alliance  Group  which  was sold in  December  1998)  was
recognized  in the period  received or,  alternatively,  accrued  when  reliably
determinable.

Revenue from  sales-type  leases is recognized at the date of shipment.  Revenue
from operating leases is recognized ratably over the lease term, and the related
equipment  is  depreciated  using the  straight-line  method over its  estimated
useful life, which approximates three years. The average length of initial lease
terms in fiscal 2000 was approximately 36 months.

Promotion and Advertising Costs

Promotion and advertising  costs are charged to operating  expense in the fiscal
year in which they are incurred.  Promotion and  advertising  costs  amounted to
$4,042,000,   $3,711,000  and   $5,287,000  in  fiscal  2000,   1999  and  1998,
respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company  accounts  for income  taxes under the  provisions  of  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 109,  "Accounting  for Income Taxes," which
requires the use of the  liability  method of  accounting  for  deferred  income
taxes.

The provision for income taxes includes federal, foreign, state and local income
taxes currently payable and deferred taxes resulting from temporary  differences
between the  financial  statement and tax basis of assets and  liabilities.  The
Company  intends to  permanently  reinvest  the  undistributed  earnings  of its
foreign subsidiaries ($12,537,000 at September 30, 2000).  Accordingly,  no U.S.
federal  income taxes have been provided on such  earnings.  In addition,  taxes
would  be  substantially  lowered  if such  earnings  were  remitted  due to net
operating loss carryforwards currently available in the United States.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Basic and  diluted  earnings  (loss) per share is computed  in  accordance  with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share." Refer
to Note  15 to the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  further
information.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of cash instruments and accounts receivable. The
Company  places  its  cash  investments   with   high-quality   U.S.   financial
institutions.

Approximately  $9,800,000,  or  32%,  of  consolidated  accounts  receivable  at
September  30,  2000   ($15,500,000,   or  41%,  at  September  30,  1999)  were
concentrated  in  telephone  companies  in  North  America  and  Europe.   These
receivables  are not  collateralized  due to the  high  credit  ratings  and the
extensive financial resources available to such telephone companies.

Foreign Currency

Assets and  liabilities of most all of the Company's  foreign  subsidiaries  are
generally  translated  using fiscal year-end  exchange  rates,  and revenues and
expenses are translated using average exchange rates prevailing during the year.
The effects of translating such foreign  subsidiaries'  financial statements are
recorded as a separate component of stockholders'  equity and have been reported
in other comprehensive income.

Included in other income are net recognized  foreign currency exchange gains and
(losses) of $643,000,  $66,000 and  $(400,000)  for fiscal 2000,  1999 and 1998,
respectively.

Post-Retirement and Post-Employment Benefits

The Company accounts for post-retirement  benefits and post-employment  benefits
under the  provisions  of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 106,
"Employers'  Accounting for  Post-Retirement  Benefits Other Than Pensions," and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers'  Accounting for
Post-Employment  Benefits,"  respectively,  each of which requires the use of an
accrual  method of accounting  for such  benefits.  The annual expense and other
disclosure information applicable to such benefits is not material.  Separately,
in fiscal 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards
No.  132,  "Employers'  Disclosures  about  Pensions  and Other  Post-retirement
Benefits" (SFAS 132). SFAS 132 standardizes the disclosure of information  about
pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

As  permitted  under  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation,"  the Company has elected to continue
to  measure  costs  for its  employee  stock  compensation  plans by  using  the
accounting  methods  prescribed by Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting  for Stock Issued to Employees,"  which allows that no  compensation
cost be recognized  provided the exercise  price of options  granted is equal to
the fair market value of the Company's stock at date of grant. Reference is made
to Note  13 of the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  further
information.

In March 2000, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board ("FASB")  issued FASB
Interpretation  ("FIN") No. 44, "Accounting for Certain  Transactions  Involving
Stock  Compensation - An  Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25." The application
of FIN 44 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of
operations.

Operating Segments

In fiscal 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards
No. 131,  "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related  Information"
(SFAS 131),  which utilizes a "management"  approach to segment  reporting.  The
management  approach  designates  the  internal  organization  that  is  used by
management  for making  operating  decisions  and assessing  performance  as the
source  of  the   Company's   reportable   segments.   SFAS  131  also  requires
enterprise-wide  disclosures about products and services,  geographic areas, and
major customers.

Comprehensive Income

Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 130, "Reporting  Comprehensive
Income" (SFAS 130) establishes standards for reporting  comprehensive income and
its components in a company's financial statements. The Company adopted SFAS 130
in fiscal 1999.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting  periods
presented.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  For example,  the
markets for the Company's  products are  characterized  by intense  competition,
rapid technological  development and frequent new product introductions,  all of
which could  impact the future  value of the  Company's  inventory,  capitalized
software, goodwill and certain other assets.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

Cash and cash  equivalents -- The carrying amount  reported in the  consolidated
balance  sheets  for cash and cash  equivalents  approximates  fair value due to
their short-term nature.

Long-term  debt -- The estimated  fair value of the Company's  $55.0 million and
$69.1 million total long-term debt (including  current portion) at September 30,
2000 and 1999, respectively,  was approximately $55.2 million and $59.6 million,
respectively.  In the case of variable  interest-rate  debt,  debt with  shorter
maturities and recently secured fixed  interest-rate debt, the Company estimates
the  fair  value  to  be  the  carrying  value.  For  other   long-term,   fixed
interest-rate  debt,  the  estimated  fair value was obtained from an investment
banker.

Future Adoption of New Accounting Statements

Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which establishes  accounting and reporting
standards for derivative  instruments and hedging activities,  becomes effective
for the Company in fiscal 2001. The Company has not yet evaluated the effects of
this pronouncement on future related disclosures.

Securities and Exchange  Commission Staff Accounting  Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements," provides the SEC staff's views in applying
generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues.
Staff Accounting  Bulletins 101A and 101B delayed the implementation of SAB 101,
which becomes  effective  for the Company in fiscal 2001.  The Company is in the
process  of  evaluating  SAB  101;  however,  implementation  of SAB  101 is not
presently expected to have a material impact on the Company's reported financial
position or results of operations.

Other newly  issued  accounting  standards  are not  expected to have a material
impact on the Company's reported financial position or results of operations.

Reclassifications

Certain  reclassifications  were  made to prior  years'  consolidated  financial
statements to conform to the current year's presentation.

3.   Restructuring of Operations and Other Charges

Fiscal year 2000 results  include a charge of $1.5 million,  or $0.06 per share,
for uncollectible lease receivables and related costs attributable to a customer
bankruptcy.  Furthermore,  fiscal  year  2000  results  include a charge of $0.5
million, or $0.02 per share, for severance costs associated with the decision to
outsource  manufacturing  operations.  All such severance  costs were paid as of
September 30, 2000.

In December 1998, the Company  restructured  its operations  into three distinct
business  units  to  increase  product  line  focus  and move  toward  operating
autonomy.  Two new business  units resulted from the  reorganization:  Broadband
Systems Division (ATM and Internetworking  products) and Network Access Division
(access  products).  The new business  units  supplemented  the  existing  VITAL
Network  Services  business unit,  which was launched in October 1997 to provide
professional services on multi-vendor networking equipment on a worldwide basis.
In addition,  the Company shut down a non-strategic  remote technology center in
England during in July 1999. Such fiscal 1999 reorganization efforts resulted in
a work  force  reduction  of  approximately  230  persons  and a charge  of $2.0
million,  or $0.09 per share (basic and diluted),  primarily for post-employment
severance benefits. All accrued costs were paid as of September 30, 2000.

The fiscal year ended September 30, 1998 includes a restructuring  of operations
charge of $2.5 million, or $0.12 per share, which is comprised of a $1.0 million
provision  for   post-employment   benefits   related  to  the   elimination  of
approximately  200  full-time  positions  and $1.5 million for the  write-off of
intangible  assets and other costs associated with the elimination of low-volume
product lines. All such costs have been paid.

4.   Sale of Assets

On December 30, 1998,  the Company sold its  Technology  Alliance Group division
("TAG"), which was identified as non-strategic to the reorganized business units
referenced in Note 3 above. TAG, which developed, patented and

                                       17
<PAGE>


licensed advanced modem and access  technologies,  was principally  comprised of
scientists and engineers and held rights to certain technologies patented by the
division.  The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $9.0 million, or
$0.41 per share, and generated cash proceeds,  net of expenses, of approximately
$12.0 million.  Technology  licensing revenues from the TAG division amounted to
$869,000  and  $3,166,000  in  fiscal  1999 and  1998,  respectively.  Licensing
revenues  are  reported  as  "Other  Revenue"  in  the  Company's   Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

On  September  30,  1999,  the Company  entered into an agreement to outsource a
substantial portion of its manufacturing  operations.  As part of the agreement,
the outsource  manufacturer  purchased the  Company's  applicable  manufacturing
assets for $3.1  million,  which  approximated  book  value;  in  addition,  the
outsource  manufacturer  procured specific raw material  inventories at net book
value. As a result, no gain or loss was recognized on the transaction.

5.  VITAL Network Services, L.L.C. Partnership With Olicom, Inc.

On October 15, 1998, the Company's VITAL Network  Services (VITAL) business unit
entered into an agreement with Olicom, Inc. whereby VITAL assumed responsibility
for  Olicom's  service  operations  in  Marlborough,  Massachusetts,  and Olicom
assigned or transferred its service contract business in North America to VITAL.
In addition to the assumption of  obligations  for a leased  facility,  VITAL is
obligated to pay Olicom a percentage  (25% in the first year, 20% thereafter) of
revenues derived from Olicom's business over a three-year  period, not to exceed
$3.8 million.  As part of the agreement,  VITAL acquired the capital assets used
in Olicom's service business.  VITAL recorded the acquisition using the purchase
method of accounting, and due to the conditional nature of the payments owing to
Olicom, no liability or corresponding  assets (including goodwill) were recorded
for these  payments  at the date of  acquisition.  During  the two  years  ended
September 30, 2000, the Company  recognized  $2.6 million of liability to Olicom
toward its three-year obligation and recorded $2.2 million of goodwill.

6.  Inventories

 ------------------------------------------------ --------------- --------------

Despite the complete outsourcing of manufacturing operations in fiscal 2000, the
Company has continued to procure certain raw material components in an effort to
use local vendors as a supplement to its primary  outsource vendors and, in some
instances, to protect itself from market shortage and long lead time exposures.

The  Company's   independent  auditors  have  expressed  uncertainty  about  the
Company's  ability  to  continue  as a going  concern  in their  opinion  on the
Company's  financial  statements.  On  January 5, 2001,  the  Company's  primary
lenders  served the Company with a notice of default  under the  Company's  Loan
Agreement  as a result of the  Company's  inability to provide such lenders with
Company financial  statements  supported by an unqualified  opinion.  While such
lenders have not  terminated  the revolving  line of credit  portion of the Loan
Agreement,  pursuant to which  advances are still  continuing,  the lenders have
reserved  their right to declare such advances due and payable  and/or limit the
amount of such future  advances,  and have  increased the interest rates on such
advances and the  outstanding  term loans.  There can be no  assurance  that the
lenders will continue to make such advances or that they will not accelerate the
maturity of amounts due under the Loan  Agreement.  Acceleration of such amounts
may in turn  result  in the  acceleration  of  maturity  of debt  owed to  other
creditors.

Revolving Credit Facility

On May 14, 1999,  the Company  entered into a three-year  $40.0 million loan and
security  agreement  with  Foothill  Capital  Corporation  to provide  funds for
operations  and  replace  the  Company's  existing  credit  facility.  The  Loan
Agreement  was  comprised  of $15.0  million in term  loans and a $25.0  million
(maximum value) revolving line of credit.

On December 30, 1999, the Company  expanded its credit facility to $70.0 million
as compared to the previous $40.0 million agreement.  The $30.0 million increase
is comprised of a $20.0 million  term-loan  and a $10.0 million  increase in the
revolving line of credit portion of the credit facility.  The expansion  results
in a $70.0 million credit facility  comprised of $35.0 million in term loans and
a $35.0 million (maximum value) revolving line of credit.

Under the revolving line of credit portion of the Loan  Agreement,  availability
is subject to satisfying a borrowing  base formula  related to levels of certain
accounts  receivable,  inventories  and  reported  stockholders'  equity and the
satisfaction of other financial covenants. Maximum funds available for borrowing
and letters of credit  under the  revolving  line of credit  portion of the Loan
Agreement  amounted to $25.4 million at September  30, 2000.  Most assets of the
Company,  including  accounts  receivable,  inventories and property,  plant and
equipment are pledged as  collateral.  Amounts  outstanding  under the revolving
line of credit  are  payable  in full upon  termination  of the Loan  Agreement.
Interest on revolver  borrowings is payable monthly at the greater of prime plus
0.625% or 7.0% per annum (the prime rate was 9.50% at September 30, 2000).

                                       19
<PAGE>

Financial  covenants of the Loan Agreement  require that the Company's  reported
stockholders'  equity,  excluding  the  impact of foreign  currency  translation
adjustments  occurring  subsequent  to March 31, 1999,  ("defined  stockholders'
equity")  equal or exceed  $10.0  million at September  30,  2000.  Such defined
stockholders'   equity   amounted  to  $23.0  million  at  September  30,  2000.
Separately,  annual capital  expenditures of $12.0 million are authorized  under
the Loan Agreement.

Notes Payable

As  discussed  above  under  "Revolving  Credit  Facility,"  the Loan  Agreement
includes  $35.0  million in term loans,  comprised of a $15.0  million term loan
dated May 14, 1999 and a $20.0 million term loan dated December 30, 1999.

The $15.0  million  in  proceeds  received  on May 14,  1999 were used to retire
outstanding  term loan debt in the amount of $8.7 million and generate funds for
operations.  The $15.0 million is comprised of two independent term loans in the
amounts of $12.0 million and a $3.0 million (the "$15 million term loans").  The
$15 million term loans bear interest at an annual rate of 12.5% during the first
year, 13.0% in the second year and 14.0% thereafter, payable monthly. Commencing
in June 2000, total monthly principal  payments in the amount of $312,500 became
payable,  and the $15  million  term  loans  are due and  payable  in full  upon
termination  or  expiration  of the Loan  Agreement.  At any point in time,  the
outstanding  balance of the original $3.0 million term loan is convertible  into
the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $5.00 per share.

The new $20.0  million  term loan bears  interest  at the higher of 13.5% or the
prime rate of interest plus 5.0% (on September 30, 2000,  the  applicable  prime
rate of interest was 9.5%), payable monthly. Commencing in March 2001, quarterly
principal  payments in the amount of $1.0 million become payable,  and the $20.0
million term loan is due and payable in full upon  termination  or expiration of
the Loan Agreement. At any point in time, up to a maximum of $4.0 million of the
outstanding  $20.0 million term loan balance is  convertible  into the Company's
common stock at a conversion price of $9.00 per share.

Separately,  the Company has entered into three-,  four- and five-year  note and
installment  purchase  agreements  collateralized  by  certain  machinery,  test
equipment,  furniture and  fixtures.  The  outstanding  balance of $1,533,000 at
September  30, 2000,  which  approximates  the net book value of the  underlying
equipment,  bears  interest at fixed rates ranging from 9.1% to 11.6%.  All such
notes will mature by fiscal 2003.

Convertible 7 3/4% Debentures and Related Conversions

On September 26, 1997, the Company  issued $25.0 million of  convertible  senior
subordinated  debentures  ("Debentures")  which mature on September 30, 2002 (if
not  converted or redeemed)  and accrue  interest at a rate of 7 3/4% per annum.
Only $3.0 million of such  debentures  remain  outstanding  as of September  30,
2000.

During the fiscal year ended  September  30,  2000,  $22.0  million of the $25.0
million in Debentures  outstanding at September 30, 1999 were converted into and
exchanged  for common  stock,  thereby  reducing  outstanding  indebtedness  and
increasing  stockholders'  equity  by  approximately  $22.0  million  and  $21.2
million,  respectively.  The  increase in  stockholders'  equity is comprised of
approximately $24.4 million of equity securities issued less non-cash charges of
$2.4 million for debt conversion  expense  (discussed below) and $0.8 million of
deferred debenture offering costs which were charged to paid-in capital.  Annual
interest  expense savings  resulting from the conversions  will approximate $1.7
million.

In various separate, unsolicited and negotiated transactions, the Company issued
an  aggregate  of  4,110,600  shares of common  stock in exchange  for the $22.0
million of Debentures referenced above, as compared to 3,772,938 shares issuable
under the  original  debenture  conversion  terms.  Issuance of the  incremental
337,662 shares resulted in a non-cash charge of $2.4 million for debt conversion
expense during the year ended September 30, 2000.

The   remaining   Debentures   outstanding,   originally   issued  to  qualified
institutional  buyers and accredited  institutional  investors,  are convertible
into shares of the  Company's  common stock at a conversion  price of $5.831 per
share,  or the  equivalent  of 171.5  shares  of common  stock  for each  $1,000
principal  amount of Debentures.  The Debentures  are  subordinated  in right of
payment to most other  indebtedness of the Company and are equal to or senior to
other subordinated indebtedness of the Company.

                                       20
<PAGE>

The  Debentures  may not be redeemed by the Company  prior to September 30, 2000
and are redeemable in whole or in part at the option of the Company at 103.1% of
principal value during the period September 30, 2000 through  September 29, 2001
if the Company's common stock trades at a level exceeding 150% of the conversion
price for a period of 20 trading days, and without  conditions at 101.55% of the
principal  value on or after September 30, 2001 or 100% of principal value on or
after September 30, 2002 (maturity).

Mortgages Payable and Mortgage Covenant Requirement

Mortgages outstanding on the Company's previous corporate  headquarters facility
(currently  for sale) and its VITAL  headquarters  and  manufacturing  facility,
which bear  interest at 90-day  LIBOR  (6.70% at  September  30,  2000) plus 2%,
amounted  to  $9,025,000   and  $9,425,000  at  September  30,  2000  and  1999,
respectively.  Quarterly principal payments of $100,000 are required until these
mortgages mature in the year 2003. In addition,  mortgages totaling $548,000 and
$986,000 at  September  30, 2000 and 1999,  respectively,  were  outstanding  on
Company  properties  in the United  Kingdom.  These  mortgages  bear interest at
six-month  LIBOR  (6.68% at  September  30, 2000) plus 1.3% and mature in fiscal
2003.

To remain in compliance with the covenant  requirements of the  above-referenced
mortgage  agreement (with an outstanding  balance of $9,025,000 at September 30,
2000)  throughout  fiscal 2001, the Company must increase  stockholders'  equity
and/or reduce the outstanding  mortgage balance during fiscal 2001.  Separately,
the  Company  must  avoid the  acceleration  of  payment  for other  outstanding
borrowings.

With respect to all  outstanding  indebtedness  of the Company at September  30,
2000 (except the 7 3/4% Debentures), risk of default and acceleration of payment
represents a risk to the Company in fiscal 2001. As a result,  such indebtedness
has been  classified as a current  liability as of September 30, 2000.  Refer to
Note 1,  "Business  Conditions and Financial  Plans," for  management  plans and
related discussion.

For regular  income tax  reporting  purposes at  September  30, 2000 foreign and
domestic  tax  credits  and  net  operating  loss   carryforwards   amounted  to
approximately $14.5 million and $202.0 million,  respectively.  Domestic federal
loss  carryforwards  of $195.0  million  expire between fiscal 2004 and 2016, of
which  approximately  $12.6  million  relate to items  which will be credited to
stockholders'  equity  when  applied;   domestic  state  loss  carryforwards  of
approximately  $115.0 million expire between fiscal 2001 and 2016.  Foreign loss
carryforwards  of $7.0  million  expire  beginning  in fiscal  2000.  Tax credit
carryforwards expire between fiscal 2001 and 2016.

For federal alternative  minimum tax purposes,  net operating loss carryforwards
amounted  to   approximately   $188.0  million  at  September  30,  2000.  These
carryforwards  may be  carried  forward  indefinitely  to offset  any  excess of
regular tax liability over alternative minimum tax liability, subject to certain
separate company limitations.

The tax effects of the significant temporary differences comprising the deferred
tax assets and  liabilities  at  September  30, 2000 and 1999 are as follows (in

Statement  of Financial  Accounting  Standard  No. 109,  "Accounting  For Income
Taxes," requires a valuation  allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on
available evidence,  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized.  The Company believes that  uncertainty  exists
with respect to the future  realization of deferred tax assets and, as a result,
carries  a  valuation  allowance  for  such  items.  The  valuation  allowances,
disclosed in the  deferred  tax summary  above,  increased  by  $14,986,000  and
$15,382,000 in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, respectively.

10.  Operating Leases

The  Company  has  certain  non-cancelable   operating  leases  on  automobiles,
subsidiary  locations,  sales offices and service facilities which expire within
one to six years.  These leases generally contain renewal options and provisions
for payment by the lessee of executory costs (taxes, maintenance and insurance).
In addition,  the Company has a  non-cancelable  operating  lease through fiscal
2003 for its Connecticut corporate offices and technology center facility.

The  following  is a schedule of the future  minimum  payments on such leases at
September 30, 2000 (in thousands):

The Common Stock  referenced above includes both Class B stock and common stock.
Class B stock,  under  certain  circumstances,  has greater  voting power in the
election of directors.  However,  common stock is entitled to cash dividends, if
and when paid, 11.11% higher per share than Class B stock. The Company has never
declared or paid cash dividends on its common stock,  and terms of the Company's
credit  facility  prohibit  the  Company  from paying  cash  dividends  with the
exception  of  dividends  authorized  for payment on the  Company's 9% preferred
stock  (referenced  below).  Class B stock has  limited  transferability  and is
convertible  into  common  stock  at any  time on a  share-for-share  basis.  At
September  30,  2000,  1999 and  1998,  Class B stock  outstanding  amounted  to
2,057,103, 2,092,383 and 2,093,083 shares, respectively.

On September 12, 2000,  the Company sold, in a private  transaction,  3,000,000
shares of common stock to the State of Wisconsin Investment Board for $5.00 per
share,  generating  proceeds of $15.0 million (before  expenses).  Approximately
$5.3 million of such proceeds have been reserved to redeem the 5% Preferred
Stock (discussed  below) in the event the conversion  price of such 5%
Preferred Stock would be  lowered  on any reset  date.  However,  as a result
of the  notice of default  served to the Company on January 5, 2001 by its
primary  lenders,  the Company may be unable to access funds from its revolving
line of credit in order to exercise its option to redeem the 5% Preferred Stock.

9% Preferred Stock
------------------
800,000 shares of the Company's 9% Cumulative Convertible Exchangeable Preferred
Stock ("9% Preferred Stock") were outstanding as of September 30, 1999 and 1998.
During fiscal 2000,  12,100 shares were converted into common shares,  resulting
in 787,900  shares  outstanding  at September 30, 2000.  The 9% Preferred  Stock
accrues  dividends  at a rate  of 9% per  annum,  cumulative  from  the  date of
issuance and payable quarterly in arrears. Dividends have been paid through June
30, 2000;  dividends in arrears  amounted to $443,194 at September 30, 2000. The
9% Preferred  Stock can be converted  into common stock at $13.65 per share,  or
the  equivalent  of 1.8315 shares of common stock for each share of 9% Preferred
Stock.  The  Company has the option to exchange  the 9%  Preferred  Stock for 9%
Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures due 2006, at the rate of $25.00  principal
amount of such  debentures for each share of 9% Preferred  Stock  outstanding at
the time of exchange.  Subject to approval of the Company's  principal  lenders,
the 9% Preferred  Stock can be redeemed by the Company on or after September 30,
2000 at a price of $25.00 per share.

Redeemable 5% Preferred Stock
-----------------------------
On July 31, 2000, the Company sold 200,000  shares of 5% Cumulative  Convertible
Preferred  Stock  ("5%  Preferred  Stock")  for  $5,000,000  to  two  accredited
investors in a negotiated  private  transaction  exempt from registration  under
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The 5% Preferred  Stock
is convertible  into one million  shares of Common Stock at $5.00 per share,  or
five shares of common  stock for each share of 5% Preferred  Stock.  The Company
has the option to cause the 5%  Preferred  Stock to convert into common stock if
the market price of the Company's  common stock  exceeds 125% of the  conversion
price, or $6.25 per share, for a specified  period,  and has the right to redeem
the 5%  Preferred  Stock at  original  issue  price  (par) in the event  certain
transactions  of  $50.0  million  or more  are  effected  by the  Company  and a
registration  statement is in effect  covering the common  stock.  Dividends are
payable quarterly at the option of the Company in common stock or cash. However,
terms  of the  Company's  current  credit  facility  prohibit  payment  of  cash
dividends on the 5% Preferred Stock; as a result, such dividends, if paid, would
be paid with common stock.

The conversion price could potentially be adjusted downward at six predetermined
reset dates commencing on January 31, 2001, and each three months thereafter, if
the average  closing price of the Company's  common stock during the ten trading
days preceding such predetermined dates falls below the conversion price then in
effect.  If, based upon downward  reductions  in the  conversion  price,  the 5%
Preferred  Stock  becomes  convertible  into more than 19.999% of common  shares
outstanding  (excluding  Class  B  and  treasury  shares),  Company  shareholder
approval  would be required for the  registration  of such shares.  It should be
noted,  however, that with proper advance notice and subject to the availability
of funds  under the  Company's  revolving  line of credit,  the  Company has the
option to redeem the 5% Preferred  Stock for $5,250,000  plus accrued  dividends
before the first  downward price  adjustment,  if any,  occurs.  The Company has
revoked its notice of exercise  to so redeem the 5%  preferred  stock on January
31, 2001.

On July 31, 2002, any outstanding 5% Preferred Stock plus accumulated  dividends
must be redeemed  or  converted.  Options  available  to the  Company  regarding
redemption and/or conversion include:  (a) conversion into common stock, subject
to the shareholder  approval  discussed above; (b) redemption by the Company for
cash; or (c) a combination  thereof.  Since the potential  need for  shareholder
approval  to issue  and list  additional  common  shares  at a

                                       24
<PAGE>

future date is a contingency outside of the Company's control,  the 5% Preferred
Stock is presented outside of permanent equity.

As part of this transaction,  the Company also issued warrants for the investors
to purchase an  additional  200,000  shares of Common  Stock at $5.75 per share.
Such  warrants  expire in five  years.  The Company has the right to redeem such
warrant shares two years after issuance for $.01 per share if certain conditions
are met.

12.   Segment and Geographical Information

The Company  reorganized in December 1998,  creating  distinct and independently
managed  Strategic  Business Units ("SBU") for specified  groups of products and
services.  Each SBU has been identified as a reportable  segment,  as summarized
below:

    .   Broadband  Systems  Division  ("BSD")  --  Designs,  markets  and  sells
        broadband telecommunication products, including ATM switches and network
        management systems which allow for the efficient  transmission of
        voice, data  and  video.  BSD also  sells  time-division  multiplexing
        ("TDM") equipment.

    .   Network  Access   Division   ("NAD")  --  Designs,   markets  and  sells
        access-type  telecommunication  products,  including frame relay and DSL
        based products.

    .   VITAL Network  Services,  L.L.C.  ("VITAL") -- An  integrated  worldwide
        service  organization which provides global traditional and professional
        network  services  for   telecommunications   carriers,   corporate  and
        government  customers.  VITAL  offers  such  support  services  for  the
        products of many companies (multi-vendor support services).

    .   DataComm Leasing  Corporation -- Provides financing  services,  offering
        BSD and NAD customers the  opportunity  to lease (rather than  purchase)
        products.

The accounting  policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note
2,  "Description  of Business and Summary of Significant  Accounting  Policies,"
except for capitalized software  accounting.  Such costs are treated as a period
expense when measuring divisional performance.

The Company  evaluates the  performance of its segments and resource  allocation
based  upon  operating   income,   before   capitalized   software   accounting,
restructuring  charges and executive level general corporate costs (i.e.,  chief
executive officer, chief operating officer,  chief financial officer,  corporate
strategic  planning,  investor  relations,  etc.).  There  are  no  intersegment
revenues,  and BSD and NAD recognize revenue for the sale of their product lines
only  (i.e.,  BSD  recognizes  no revenue  for the sale of NAD  product and vice
versa).

The  tables  below  present  financial  performance  information  by  reportable
segments  (in  thousands).  Asset  information  by  reportable  segment  is  not
reported, as the Company does not produce such information internally.

Foreign revenue is based on the country in which the revenue  originated  (i.e.,
where the legal  subsidiary  is domiciled  or, in the case of sales  through the
Company's  international  distributor  network,  where the customer  placing the
order is domiciled).  No individual foreign location accounted for more than ten
percent of consolidated revenue or long-lived assets.  Separately, no individual
customer  accounted  for more than ten  percent  of the  Company's  consolidated
revenue.

13.  Employee Incentive Plans

Stock Option Plans

Officers and key employees may be granted incentive stock options at an exercise
price  equal to or  greater  than  the  market  price  on the date of grant  and
non-incentive  stock  options  at an  exercise  price  equal to or less than the
market price on the date of grant.  While individual options can be issued under
various provisions,  most options, once granted, generally vest in increments of
25% per year over a  four-year  period  and expire  within ten years.  Under the
terms of these stock option plans, the Company has reserved a total of 5,126,435
shares of common stock at September 30, 2000 (4,765,351  shares at September 30,
1999).

The following  summarizes  activity under these stock option plans for the three
fiscal years ended September 30, 2000:

The weighted  average option price of exercisable  options was $6.22,  $6.81 and
$6.68 at September 30, 2000,  1999 and 1998,  respectively.  All options granted
during the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2000 were granted at an option
price equal to fair market value at date of grant.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has a stock  purchase plan to encourage  employees to participate in
the Company's future growth. At September 30, 2000, 346,289 shares were reserved
for purchase by employees through payroll deductions regularly  accumulated over
six-month  payment periods.  At the end of each payment period,  common stock is
purchased  at 85 percent  of the market  value of the stock on the first or last
day of the payment periods,  whichever is lower. However, the purchase of common
stock  under this plan is  prohibited  if 85 percent of the market  value of the
common  stock is less than the book  value per  share.  Note 11,  "Stockholders'
Equity,"  presents  the  historical  activity  under this plan  during the three
fiscal years ended September 30, 2000.

Employee Retirement Savings and Deferred Profit Sharing Plan

Under  the  retirement  savings  provisions  of the  Company's  retirement  plan
established  under Section  401(k) of the Internal  Revenue Code,  employees are
generally  eligible to  contribute  to the plan after three months of continuous
service in amounts determined by the plan. The Company contributes an additional
50 percent of the employee  contribution  up to certain  limits (not to exceed 2
percent of total eligible  compensation).  Employees  become fully vested in the
Company's   contributions  after  three  years  of  continuous  service,  death,
disability,  or upon  reaching  age 65. The  amounts  charged to expense for the
fiscal years ended September 30, 2000,  1999 and 1998 were $918,000,  $1,245,400
and $1,015,100, respectively.

The deferred profit sharing  provisions of the plan include retirement and other
related benefits for  substantially  all of the Company's  full-time  employees.
Contributions  under the plan are funded  annually and are based,  at a minimum,
upon a formula  measuring  profitability  in  relation to  revenues.  Additional
amounts may be contributed at the discretion of the Company.  There were no such
contributions for fiscal 2000, 1999 or 1998.

Stock-Based Compensation

Lease Financing Programs

DataComm Leasing Corporation  maintains  agreements with financial  institutions
whereby  certain finance lease  receivables are transferred  with full recourse.
The  underlying   equipment  is  retained  as  collateral  by  DataComm  Leasing
Corporation.  No receivables  were  transferred  in fiscal 1998,  1999 or fiscal
2000. The balance of all  transferred  receivables  which were due to be paid by
the original  lessees  under the remaining  lease terms  amounted to $12,000 and
$235,000 at of September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

15.  Earnings (Loss) Per Share

The  following  table sets forth the  computation  of basic and diluted loss per
share (in thousands, except per share amounts):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic and diluted loss per share        $ (1.51)         $(1.12)      $(1.64)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The net loss for the fiscal year ended  September 30, 2000 includes three unique
expense items:  First,  there was a charge of $1.5 million,  or $0.06 per share,
for uncollectible lease receivables and related costs attributable to a customer
bankruptcy;  second,  there were non-cash charges of $2.4 million,  or $0.09 per
share, for debt conversion expense resulting from the conversion and exchange of
$22.0 million in convertible debentures for common stock; and third, there was a
restructuring  charge of $0.5 million,  or $0.02 per share,  for severance costs
associated with the decision to outsource manufacturing operations. The net loss
for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1999 includes a restructuring  charge of
$2.0 million,  or $0.09 per share, for restructuring of operations.  Fiscal 1998
results include a similar charge of $2.5 million,  or $0.12 per share.  Refer to
Note 3, "Restructuring of Operations and Other Charges," for further discussion.

Outstanding securities,  not included in the above computations because of their
antidilutive  impact on reported loss per share,  which could potentially dilute
diluted  earnings  per  share  in the  future  include  convertible  debentures,
convertible  preferred  stock and  employee  stock  options  and  warrants.  For
additional disclosure information,

                                       29
<PAGE>

including conversion terms, refer to Notes 8, 11 and 13, respectively.  Weighted
average  employee  stock options  outstanding  during  fiscal 2000  approximated
4,119,219  shares,  of which  1,011,716  would not have been included in diluted
earnings  per share  calculations  for fiscal 2000 (if the Company  reported net
income) because the effect would be antidilutive.

(1)  The first quarter of fiscal 2000 includes a restructuring  charge of $0.5
     million,  or $0.02 per share,  for severance  costs  associated  with the
     decision to outsource  manufacturing  operations  and a non-cash  charge of
     $1.5 million, or $0.07 per share, for debt conversion expense resulting
     from the  conversion  and  exchange of  convertible  debentures  for common
     stock.

(2)  The second  quarter  of fiscal  2000  includes a non-cash  charge of $0.9
     million,  or $0.03 per share, for debt conversion  expense resulting from
     additional  conversions and exchanges of convertible  debentures for common
     stock.

(3)  The third  quarter of fiscal 2000 includes a charge of $2.0  million,  or
     $.08 per share,  for  uncollectible  lease  receivables and related costs
     attributable to a customer bankruptcy.

(4)  The fourth  quarter of fiscal 2000  includes a credit of $0.5  million,  or
     $0.02 per share, related to the above-referenced customer bankruptcy.  Such
     charge was originally  estimated to approximate  $2.0 million (in the third
     fiscal  quarter),  and was reduced by $0.5  million  (in the fourth  fiscal
     quarter) based upon updated cost estimates.

(5) The first quarter of fiscal 1999 includes a charge of $2.0 million, or $0.09
    per share, for  restructuring  of operations and a gain of $9.0 million,  or
    $0.41 per share, from the sale of a non-strategic division.

(6) Loss per  share  amounts  for  each  quarter  are  required  to be  computed
    independently  and,  in both fiscal 2000 and  fiscal  1999,  did not equal
    the full year loss per share amounts.

17.  Subsequent Event

On October 27, 2000, a wholly-owned  Company  subsidiary settled a lawsuit which
provided the Company with $5.5 million of  proceeds,  before  related  expenses.
Approximately  $5.0 million (net of expenses)  will be included as income in the
Company's financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2000.

18.  Presentation of 5% Preferred Stock

At September 30, 2000,  the Company had  originally  classified the 5% Preferred
Stock  discussed  in Note  11,  "Stockholders'  Equity,"  as  permanent  equity.
Shareholder  approval  may be required in the future to  authorize  issuance and
listing of shares of common  stock  needed to convert  outstanding  5% Preferred
Stock into common stock on July 31, 2002. Since such  shareholder  approval is a
contingency  outside of the  Company's  control,  the 5% Preferred  Stock is now
presented outside of permanent equity.

                                       30

The restatement of the fiscal 2000 financial statements for the matter described
above  had  no  affect  on  the  Company's  net  loss,  total  assets  or  total
liabilities.
