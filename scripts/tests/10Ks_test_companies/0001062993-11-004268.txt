<P align=justify>As used in this annual report, the terms we", "us", "our" and

Takedown Fight Media Inc., a Nevada corporation, unless otherwise indicated.
</P>
<P align=justify>COMPANY OVERVIEW </P>
<P align=justify>We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 12, 2008 as
Silver Bay Resources Inc., with the intention of carrying on business as a
mineral exploration company and issued 22,000,000 shares of common stock on June
12, 2008 for cash of $20,000. On June 30, 2010 we changed our name to Takedown
Entertainment Inc., to better reflect a change of business direction. In
addition, on June 30, 2010 we effected a forward split of our issued and
authorized shares on the basis of five new shares for one old share (5:1). </P>
<P align=justify>During 2008 we staked one mineral claim located 100 km
northwest of Vancouver, British Columbia and acquired a molybdenum property
comprised of one mineral claim located approximately 35 kilometers north of
Vancouver, British Columbia. Due to a lack of funding we were unable to proceed
with the exploration of the properties and mineral property costs of $20,000 has
been expensed. Both properties have since been abandoned by the Company. We did
not proceed with further exploration of the mineral claims due to a
determination that the results of our initial geological program did not
generate investor interest in the claims and we were unable to finance further
exploration.</P>
<P align=justify>We had $111,799 in cash reserves as of the year ended July 31,
2011. We anticipate that we will incur $50,000 for administrative expenses,
including professional legal and accounting expenses associated with compliance
with our periodic reporting requirements over the next twelve months, and
approximately $100,000 per month to continue with our business development. </P>
<P align=justify>We are contemplating raising additional capital to finance our
business operations. No final decisions regarding financing have been made at
this time. </P>
<P align=justify>Our company, by the efforts of our president, Peter E. Wudy, is
an integrated media and sports entertainment company involved in the
acquisition, production, licensing, marketing and distribution of mixed martial
arts (&#147;MMA&#148;) content, programming and merchandising for North American and
International markets. Quite simply, Takedown will deliver the MMA fights that
people want to see. Through strategic investment, underwriting, licensing and
royalty agreements Takedown works with MMA fight organizations around the world,
allowing them to access untapped revenue streams of a wider distribution.
Takedown licenses and acquires certain rights from each MMA fight organization
including live fight footage, brands &amp; trademarks, digital media &amp;
content, consumer products &amp; merchandise and advertising &amp; sponsorship
representation, then leverages these rights across virtually all media outlets
and distribution channels. </P>

<P align=justify>Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Takedown Fight Media Inc.,
a Nevada corporation, all operations are structured around four business
divisions, collectively responsible for executing our corporate business
strategy. These divisions are involved in: 1) identifying investment,
acquisition and licensing opportunities, 2) building relationships with fight
promoters, fighters, digital media publishers, licensees and advertisers, 3)
developing, distributing and licensing all products and services, and 4)
creating and marketing the Takedown brand. </P>
<P align=justify>It is anticipated that funding for our MMA project will come
from one or more of the following means: engaging in an offering of our stock;
engaging in borrowing; locating a joint venture partner or partners.</P>
<P align=justify>OUR CURRENT BUSINESS</P>
<P align=justify>We are an integrated media and sports entertainment company

<P align=justify>Our operations involve the aggregation of MMA fights and
content from fight promoters, fighters and digital media publishers, the
packaging of content and programming for distribution to broadcasters and
digital media platforms, the representation of opportunities to advertisers and
sponsors, the development and licensing of home entertainment and consumer
products, and the marketing of it all to a global audience of MMA fans. </P>
<P align=justify>Through strategic investment, underwriting, licensing and

<P align=justify>On January 31, 2011, we entered into a convertible loan
agreement with Triumph Capital Inc. Under the terms of the convertible loan
agreement, Triumph has agreed to loan to our company up to $1,000,000. The loan
is convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price set at 75% of
the average closing bid prices for the ten trading days immediately preceding
the conversion date. The loan will bear interest at 7.5% per annum. The

disclosure rules of Regulation S-K for a small business issuer under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We are subject to disclosure filing
requirements including filing a Form 10K annually and Forms 10Q quarterly. In
addition, we will file a Form 8K and other proxy and information statements from
time to time as required. We do not intend to voluntarily file the above reports
in the event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the
Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the

the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.

<P align=justify><B><U>Item 1A. Risk Factors</U></B><B> </B></P>
<P align=justify>THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN
OUR COMMON STOCK. BEFORE MAKING A DECISION CONCERNING THE PURCHASE OF OUR
SECURITIES, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS AND OTHER
INFORMATION IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT WHEN YOU EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS.</P>
<P align=justify>BUSINESS RISKS: </P>
<P align=justify><B>Risks Associated with our company</B>. We have limited
operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate the investment merits of
our company.</P>
<P align=justify><B>If we do not obtain additional financing, our business will
fail because we will be unable to fund even the administration of our minimal
operations</B>. In order for our company to continue we need to obtain
additional financing. As of July 31, 2011 we had $111,799 cash on hand. We
currently have limited operations.</P>
<P align=justify><B>The future issuance of debt may contain contractual
restrictions that may curtail implementation of our business plan</B>. We do not
have any contractual restrictions limiting our ability to incur debt. Any
significant indebtedness, however, could restrict our ability to fully implement
our business plan. If we are unable to repay the debt, we could be forced to
cease operating. </P>
<P align=justify><B>The loss of any of our key personnel may affect our ability
to implement our business plan and cause our stock to decline in value</B>. We
are dependent on Peter E. Wudy, president and director of our company, to
implement our business plan. The loss of his services may have a negative effect
on our ability to timely and successfully implement our business plan. We do not
have an employment agreement with Mr. Wudy and we have not obtained key man
insurance over him. </P>
<P align=justify>INVESTMENT RISKS: </P>
<P align=justify><B>Our issuance of additional shares may have the effect of
diluting the interest of shareholders; our common stock shareholders do not have
preemptive rights</B>. Any additional issuances of common stock by us from our
authorized but unissued shares may have the effect of diluting the percentage
interest of existing shareholders. The securities issued to raise funds may have
rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of the holders of our
other securities, including our common stock. The board of directors has the
power to issue such shares without shareholder approval. We fully intend to
issue additional common shares in order to raise capital to fund our business
operations and growth objectives. </P>
<P align=justify><B>We do not anticipate paying dividends to our common
stockholders in the foreseeable future, which makes investment in our stock
speculative and risky</B>. We have not paid dividends on our common stock and do
not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
The board of directors has sole authority to declare dividends payable to our
stockholders. The fact that we have not paid and do not plan to pay dividends
indicates that we must use all of our funds we generate for reinvestment in our
business activities. Investors also must evaluate an investment in our company
solely on the basis of anticipated capital gains. </P>
<P align=center>9 </P>
<HR style="PAGE-BREAK-AFTER: always" align=center width="100%" color=black
noShade SIZE=5>
<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_10></A>
<P align=justify><B>Limited liability of our executive officers and directors
may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against them</B>. Our
memorandum and articles of incorporation contain provisions that limit the
liability of our directors for monetary damages and provide for indemnification
of officers and directors. These provisions may discourage shareholders from
bringing a lawsuit against officers and directors for breaches of fiduciary duty
and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and
directors even though such action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited
the shareholders. In addition, a shareholder's investment in our company may be
adversely affected to the extent that we pay costs of settlement and damage
awards against officers or directors pursuant to the indemnification provisions
of the bylaw. The impact on a shareholder's investment in terms of the cost of
defending a lawsuit may deter the shareholder from bringing suit against any of
our officers or directors. We have been advised that the SEC takes the position
that these article and bylaw provisions do not affect the liability of any
director under applicable federal and state securities laws. </P>
<P align=justify><B>We are a development stage company and we expect to incur
operating losses for the foreseeable future. </B>We were incorporated on June
12, 2008 and our business to date has been principally organizational
activities. We have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be
successful. We have earned limited revenues as of the date of this annual
report. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally
encountered by startup companies and the high rate of failure of such
enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the
problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in
connection with the business that we plan to undertake. These potential problems
include, but are not limited to, additional costs and expenses that may exceed
current estimates. We anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses
without realizing any revenues. We recognize that if business revenues are not
forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no
history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will
prove successful, and if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our
business will most likely fail.</P>
<P align=justify><B>We have yet to earn continuous or sufficient revenue and our
ability to sustain our operations is dependent on our ability to raise
additional financing. As a result there is substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. </B>We have accumulated net losses of $1,001,069
for the period from inception June 12, 2008 to July 31, 2011 and have
insuffcient revenues to date. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain
financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of our
business. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue
as a going concern. Our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion could materially
limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity
securities or otherwise. If we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed, we
will not be able to complete our business plan. As a result we may have to
liquidate our business and you may lose your investment. You should consider our
auditor's comments when determining if an investment in our company is suitable.
</P>
<P align=justify><B>Because our current officers and directors have other
business interests, they may not be able or willing to devote a sufficient
amount of time to our business operations, causing our business to fail. </B>Mr.
Peter E. Wudy, our President and director, currently devotes his full attention
providing services to our company. While he presently possesses adequate time to
attend to our interest, it is possible that the demands on him from other
obligations could increase, with the result that he would no longer be able to
devote sufficient time to the management of our business. This could negatively
impact our business development.</P>
<P align=justify><B>We may be unable to obtain additional capital that we may
require to implement our business plan. This would restrict our ability to grow.
</B>The proceeds from our financing efforts to date have provided us with a
limited amount of working capital not sufficient to fund our proposed
operations. We will require additional capital to continue to operate our
business and our proposed operations. We may be unable to obtain additional
capital as and when required. </P>
<P align=justify>Future acquisitions and future development, production and
marketing activities, as well as our administrative requirements (such as
salaries, insurance expenses and general overhead expenses, as well as legal
compliance costs and accounting expenses) will require a substantial amount of
additional capital and cash flow. </P>
<P align=justify>We may not be successful in locating suitable financing
transactions in the time period required or at all, and we may not obtain the
capital we require by other means. If we do not succeed in raising additional
capital, the capital we have received to date is not sufficient to fund our
operations going forward without obtaining additional capital financing. </P>
<P align=center>10 </P>
<HR style="PAGE-BREAK-AFTER: always" align=center width="100%" color=black
noShade SIZE=5>
<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_11></A>
<P align=justify>Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity may
dilute your ownership percentage. This could result in a decrease in the fair
market value of our equity securities because our assets would be owned by a
larger pool of outstanding equity. The terms of securities we issue in future
may be more favorable to our new investors, and may include preferences,
superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative
securities, and issuances of incentive awards under equity employee incentive
plans, which may have a further dilutive effect. </P>
<P align=justify>Our ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by such
factors as the capital markets generally, our status as a new enterprise without
a demonstrated operating history or the retention or loss of key management. If
the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities is not
sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may be required to cease our
operations. </P>
<P align=justify>We may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital
financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees,
securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other
costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with
certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which
may adversely impact our financial condition. </P>
<P align=justify><B>The limited trading of our common stock on the OTC bulletin
board may impair your ability to sell your shares. </B></P>
<P align=justify>There has been no trading market for our common stock since our
inception. The lack of trading of our common stock and the low volume of any
future trading may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish
to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. Such factors may also
impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of capital stock and may
impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using common
stock as consideration. </P>
<P align=justify><B>The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly
volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. </B>Assuming we are able to establish
an active trading market for our common stock, the market price of our common
stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations
in response to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including: </P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>dilution caused by our issuance of additional shares of common stock and
  other forms of equity securities, which we expect to make in connection with
  future capital financings to fund our operations and growth, to attract and
  retain valuable personnel and in connection with future strategic partnerships
  with other companies;
  <LI>announcements of acquisitions or other business initiatives by our
  competitors;
  <LI>market changes in the demand for products and services;
  <LI>quarterly variations in our revenues and operating expenses;
  <LI>changes in the valuation of similarly situated companies, both in our
  industry and in other industries;
  <LI>changes in analysts' estimates affecting us, our competitors or our
  industry;
  <LI>additions and departures of key personnel;
  <LI>fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of capital in the
  capital markets; </LI></UL>
<P align=justify>These and other factors are largely beyond our control, and the
impact of these risks, singly or in the aggregate, may result in material
adverse changes to the market price of our common stock and our results of
operations and financial condition.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Our operating results may fluctuate significantly, and these
fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline. </B></P>
<P align=justify>Our operating results will likely vary in the future primarily
as the result of fluctuations in our revenues and operating expenses, costs that
we incur, and other factors. If our results of operations do not meet the
expectations of current or potential investors, the price of our common stock
may decline.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Applicable sec rules governing the trading of "penny stocks"
will limit the trading and liquidity of our common stock, which may affect the
trading price of our common stock. </B>Our common stock is presently considered
to be a "penny stock" and is subject to SEC rules and regulations which impose
limitations upon the manner in which such shares may be publicly traded and
which regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in "penny
stocks." Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than
$5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges
or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume
information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the
exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a
transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a
standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny
stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with
current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the
broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account
statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's
account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that prior to a
transaction in a penny stock, the broker-dealer make a special written
determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser
and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These
disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading
activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny
stock rules which may increase the difficulty investors may experience in
attempting to liquidate such securities.</P>

<P align=justify>The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our
audited financial statements and the related notes for the years ended July 31,
2011 and July 31, 2010 that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The
following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans,
estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those
discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or
contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed
below and elsewhere in this annual report. </P>
<P align=justify>Our audited financial statements are stated in United States
Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles. </P>
<P align=justify>PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT</P>

<P align=justify><U>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</U></P>
<P align=justify>We are still in the development stage and have generated
minimal revenues to date. </P>
<P align=justify>We incurred operating losses of $1,001,069 from date of
incorporation June 12, 2008 to the year ended July 31, 2011. These losses
consisted of general operating expenses and professional fees incurred in
connection with the day to day operation of our business, the preparation and
filing of our periodic reports and the development of our media content, systems
and business. Our net loss for the year ending July 31, 2011 was $829,978. </P>
<P align=justify>Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means
that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for
the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills.
This is because we have not generated revenues. There is no assurance we will
ever generate revenues. We are still in our development stage and have generated
no revenues to date. The following table provides selected financial data about
our company for the years ended July 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 and the period from
inception June 12, 2008 to July 31, 2008.</P>

<P align=justify>PLAN OF OPERATION</P>
<P align=justify>We are not currently able to fund our levels of operations for

<P align=justify>The future of our company is dependent upon its ability to
obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of
acquisitions. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a private
placement and public offering of its common stock.</P>
<P align=justify>We estimate that our expenses over the next 12 months will be
approximately $1,550,000,000 as described in the table below. These estimates
may change significantly depending on the performance of our products in the

acceptable to us. We may not raise sufficient funds to fully carry out our
business plan.</P>
<P align=justify>FUTURE FINANCINGS </P>
<P align=justify>We will require additional financing in order to enable us to
proceed with our plan of operations, as discussed above, including approximately
$1,550,000,000 over the next 12 months to pay for our ongoing expenses. These
expenses include legal, accounting and audit fees as well as general and
administrative expenses. These cash requirements are in excess of our current
cash and working capital resources. Accordingly, we will require additional
financing in order to continue operations and to repay our liabilities. There is
no assurance that any party will advance additional funds to us in order to
enable us to sustain our plan of operations or to repay our liabilities. </P>
<P align=justify>We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common
stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of

<P align=justify>We have generated minimal revenue since inception and are

<P align=justify>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES </P>
<P align=justify>The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and
assumptions are affected by management&#146;s application of accounting policies. We
believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions
involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to
an understanding of our financial statements.</P>
<P align=justify><I><U>Basis of Presentation</U></I><I> </I></P>
<P align=justify>Our company follows accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. In the opinion of management all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of
financial position and the results of operations for the periods presented have
been reflected herein. </P>
<P align=justify><I><U>Revenue Recognition</U></I><I> </I></P>
<P align=justify>Our company will recognize revenue in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification No. 605, <I>Revenue Recognition</I>
("ASC-605"), ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before
revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)
delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4)
collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are
based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices
of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions
for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and
other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are
recorded. Our company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been
delivered or is subject to refund until such time that our company and the
customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will
be required.</P>
<P align=justify><I><U>Use of Estimates</U></I><I> </I></P>
<P align=justify>The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Our company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions
related to deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. Our company bases its
estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various
other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not
readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by our
company may differ materially and adversely from our company&#146;s estimates. To the
extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual
results, future results of operations will be affected. </P>
<P align=justify><I><U>Cash and Cash Equivalents</U></I><I> </I></P>
<P align=justify>For purposes of the statement of cash flows, our company
considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of July 31, 2011 our company had
$111,799 in cash or cash equivalents (July 31, 2010, $0.00) . </P>

<P align=justify>Our company is considered a development stage company, having
limited operating revenues during the period presented, as defined by Accounting
Standards Codification ASC 915-205 &#147;Development-Stage Entities&#148;. ASC 915-205
requires companies to report their operations, shareholders equity and cash
flows since inception through the date that revenues are generated from
management&#146;s intended operations, among other things.</P>

<P align=justify><I><U>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</U></I><I> </I></P>
<P align=justify>Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, an entity is required to maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring
fair value. ASC 820 and 825 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the
level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure
fair value. A financial instrument&#146;s categorization within the fair value
hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the
fair value measurement. ASC 820 and 825 prioritizes the inputs into three levels
that may be used to measure fair value: </P>
<P align=justify>Level 1 </P>
<P align=justify>Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. </P>
<P align=justify>Level 2 </P>
<P align=justify>Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs
other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices
for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or
infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in
which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or
corroborated by, observable market data. </P>
<P align=justify>Level 3 </P>
<P align=justify>Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are
unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the
measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.</P>
<P align=justify>Our company&#146;s financial instruments consist principally of
cash, accounts payable and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820
and 825, the fair value of our cash is determined based on &#147;Level 1&#148; inputs,
which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. We
believe that the recorded values of all of our other financial instruments
approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective
maturity dates or durations.</P>
<P align=justify><I><U>Income Taxes</U></I><I> </I></P>
<P align=justify>Our company provides for income taxes under ASC 740, Accounting
for Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in
accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded
based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets
and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected
to reverse.</P>
<P align=justify>ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a
valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more
likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.</P>
<P align=justify>Our company has $1,001,069 of net operating losses carried
forward to offset taxable income in future years which expire commencing in
fiscal 2030. The income tax benefit differs from the amount computed by applying
the US federal income tax rate of 34% to net loss before income taxes for the
year ended July 31, 2011 and had no uncertain tax positions as at July 31, 2011:

<P align=justify><I><U>Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Common Share</U></I><I>
</I></P>
<P align=justify>Our company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC
260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted
earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is
computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by
the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the
period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible
preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the
average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares
assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted
EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti dilutive. As
at July 31, 2011 and 2010, our company had no potentially dilutive shares. </P>
<P align=justify><I><U>Stock Based Compensation</U></I><I> </I></P>
<P align=justify>Our company records stock based compensation in accordance with
the guidance in ASC Topic 718 which requires our company to recognize expenses
related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards. This eliminates
accounting for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value
and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a
fair-value-based method. Our company recognizes the cost of all share-based
awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award. </P>

</B></P>
<P align=justify><B>To the Board of Directors </B></P>
<P align=justify>Takedown Entertainment, Inc. <BR>(A Development Stage Company)
</P>
<P align=justify>We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Takedown
Entertainment, Inc. (a development stage company, formerly known as Silver Bay
Resources) as of July 31, 2011 and 2010 the related statements of operations,
changes in stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for the years ended July 31,
2011 and 2010 and for the period from June 12, 2008 (inception) through July 31,
2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. </P>
<P align=justify>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>
<P align=justify>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Takedown
Entertainment, Inc., as of July 30, 2011 and 2010, and the results of its
operations and cash flows for the periods described above in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. </P>
<P align=justify>The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company has a working capital deficit and
incurred an accumulated net loss from operations, which raises substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding
those matters also are described in Note 3. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

<P align=justify>NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS </P>
<P align=justify>The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Nevada on June 12, 2008. On June 30, 2010 the Company changed its name to
Takedown Entertainment Inc. and changed its business focus to mixed martial arts
media entertainment. </P>
<P align=justify>The Company is an integrated media and sports entertainment
company, organized to acquire, produce and distribute mixed martial arts (MMA)
content and programming for North American and International markets. Takedown
will license and acquire certain rights from select MMA fight organizations
including live fight footage, brands &amp; trademarks, digital media &amp;
content, consumer products, merchandise and advertising and sponsorship
representation, then leverage these rights across media outlets and distribution
channels. </P>
<P align=justify>CONCENTRATIONS AND ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE<br>
  During the year ended July 31, 2011 one customer accounted for
100% of the Company's revenue.</P>
<P align=justify>NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES </P>
<P align=justify>BASIS OF PRESENTATION <BR>The Company follows accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of
management all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of
operations for the periods presented have been reflected herein. </P>
<P align=justify>REVENUE RECOGNITION <BR>The Company will recognize revenue in
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 605, REVENUE RECOGNITION
("ASC-605"), ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before
revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)
delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4)
collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are
based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices
of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions
for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and
other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are
recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been
delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the
customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will
be required.</P>
<P align=justify>USE OF ESTIMATES <BR>The preparation of the financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates
and assumptions related to deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The
Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical
experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and
expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results
experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the
Company&#146;s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the
estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
</P>
<P align=justify>CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS <BR>For purposes of the statement of
cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of July
31, 2011 the Company had $111,799 in cash or cash equivalents (July 31, 2010,
$0.00) . </P>

<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_F-6></A>
<P align=justify>DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY <BR>The Company is considered a
development stage company, having limited operating revenues during the period
presented, as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ASC 915-205
&#147;Development-Stage Entities&#148;. ASC 915-205 requires companies to report their
operations, shareholders equity and cash flows since inception through the date
that revenues are generated from management&#146;s intended operations, among other
things.</P>
<P align=justify>FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS <BR>Pursuant to ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, an
entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 and 825 establishes a
fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence
surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument&#146;s
categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 and 825
prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:
</P>
<P align=justify>Level 1 <BR>Applies to assets or liabilities for which there
are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. </P>
<P align=justify>Level 2 <BR>Applies to assets or liabilities for which there
are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or
liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with
insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or
model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be
derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. </P>
<P align=justify>Level 3 <BR>Applies to assets or liabilities for which there
are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the
measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. </P>
<P align=justify>The Company&#146;s financial instruments consist principally of
cash, accounts payable and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820
and 825, the fair value of our cash is determined based on &#147;Level 1&#148; inputs,
which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. We
believe that the recorded values of all of our other financial instruments
approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective
maturity dates or durations. </P>
<P align=justify>INCOME TAXES <BR>The Company provides for income taxes under
ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and
liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect
when these differences are expected to reverse.</P>
<P align=justify>ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a
valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more
likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.</P>
<P align=justify>The Company has $1,001,069 of net operating losses carried
forward to offset taxable income in future years which expire commencing in
fiscal 2030. The income tax benefit differs from the amount computed by applying
the US federal income tax rate of 34% to net loss before income taxes for the
year ended July 31, 2011 and had no uncertain tax positions as at July 31, 2011:
</P>
<P align=justify>Net deferred tax assets consist of the following components as
of: </P>

<P align=justify>BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE <BR>The Company
computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC
260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;)
on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss
available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of
shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to
all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the
treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted
method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used
in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of
stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if
their effect is anti dilutive. As at July 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no
potentially dilutive shares. </P>
<P align=justify>STOCK BASED COMPENSATION <BR>The Company records stock based
compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 718 which requires the
Company to recognize expenses related to the fair value of its employee stock
option awards. This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation
transactions using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such
transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company
recognizes the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the
vesting period of the award. </P>
<P align=justify>RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS <BR>The Company does not
expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a
significant effect on its financial statements. </P>
<P align=justify>In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-05, &#147;Comprehensive Income (Topic
220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income&#148;, which is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. ASU 2011-05 will become
effective for the Company on January 1, 2012. This guidance eliminates the
option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the
statement of changes in stockholders&#146; equity. In addition, items of other
comprehensive income that are reclassified to profit or loss are required to be
presented separately on the face of the financial statements. This guidance is
intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial
statements by requiring that such amounts be presented either in a single
continuous statement of income and comprehensive income or separately in
consecutive statements of income and comprehensive income. The adoption of ASU
2011-05 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or
results of operations. </P>
<P align=justify>In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, &#147;Fair Value
Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and
Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs&#148;, which is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. This guidance amends
certain accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value
measurements. Additional disclosure requirements in the update include: (1) for
Level 3 fair value measurements, quantitative information about unobservable
inputs used, a description of the valuation processes used by the entity, and a
qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements to changes in
the unobservable inputs; (2) for an entity&#146;s use of a nonfinancial asset that is
different from the asset&#146;s highest and best use, the reason for the difference;
(3) for financial instruments not measured at fair value but for which
disclosure of fair value is required, the fair value hierarchy level in which
the fair value measurements were determined; and (4) the disclosure of all
transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. ASU 2011-04
will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2012. The Company does not
expect that the guidance effective in future periods will have a material impact
on its financial statements. </P>
<P align=justify>In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-02, &#147;Receivables (Topic
310): A Creditor&#146;s Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt
Restructuring&#148;. This amendment explains which modifications constitute troubled
debt restructurings (&#147;TDR&#148;). Under the new guidance, the definition of a
troubled debt restructuring remains essentially unchanged, and for a loan
modification to be considered a TDR, certain basic criteria must still be met.
For public companies, the new guidance is effective for interim and annual
periods beginning on or after June 15, 2011, and applies retrospectively to
restructuring occurring on or after the beginning of the fiscal year of
adoption. The Company does not expect that the guidance effective in future
periods will have a material impact on its financial statements. </P>

<P align=justify>In January 2010, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC 820, Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosure, to require reporting entities to separately
disclose the amounts and business rationale for significant transfers in and out
of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and separately present
information regarding purchase, sale, issuance, and settlement of Level 3 fair
value measures on a gross basis. This standard, for which the Company is
currently assessing the impact, is effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2009 with the exception of disclosures
regarding the purchase, sale, issuance, and settlement of Level 3 fair value
measures which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010.
The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on
the Company&#146;s financial statements. </P>
<P align=justify>In October 2009, FASB issued an amendment to the accounting
standards related to the accounting for revenue in arrangements with multiple
deliverables including how the arrangement consideration is allocated among
delivered and undelivered items of the arrangement. Among the amendments, this
standard eliminated the use of the residual method for allocating arrangement
considerations and requires an entity to allocate the overall consideration to
each deliverable based on an estimated selling price of each individual
deliverable in the arrangement in the absence of having vendor-specific
objective evidence or other third party evidence of fair value of the
undelivered items. This standard also provides further guidance on how to
determine a separate unit of accounting in a multiple-deliverable revenue
arrangement and expands the disclosure requirements about the judgments made in
applying the estimated selling price method and how those judgments affect the
timing or amount of revenue recognition. This standard, for which the Company is
currently assessing the impact, will become effective on January 1, 2011. </P>
<P align=justify>The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements
that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the
financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not
believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been
issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of
operations. </P>
<P align=justify>NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN </P>
<P align=justify>The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal
course of business. However, the Company has accumulated a loss and has a
limited operating history. This raises substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.</P>
<P align=justify>As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company
has incurred a net loss of $1,001,069 for the period from June 12, 2008
(inception) to July 31, 2011 and has generated minimal revenues. The future of
the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future
profitable operations from the development of acquisitions. Management has plans
to seek additional capital through a private placement and public offering of
its common stock. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the
amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the
event the Company cannot continue in existence. </P>
<P align=justify>NOTE 4 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS </P>
<P align=justify>A shareholder loaned the Company $0, $1,256, $26,150 and
$60,000 during the periods ended July 31, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008. This loan
is due on demand. Interest at 8% totaling $8,634, $6,446, $6,657 and $307 for
the years and period ended July 31, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, has
been imputed on the outstanding amounts. (see also note 6 &#150; stock payable) </P>
<P align=justify>During the year ended July 31, 2011 the Company accrued
management fees payable of $90,000 to a director of the Company for services as
an officer of the Company (2010 - $18,750) and paid $12,000 to a director in
compensation for services provided (2010 - $nil). </P>
<P align=justify>The above transactions were in the normal course of operations
and were measured at the exchange amount, which is the amount of consideration
established and agreed to by the related parties. </P>

<P align=justify>NOTE 5 - COMMON STOCK </P>
<P align=justify>The Company issued 110,000,000 shares of common stock
(founder&#146;s shares) for $20,000 cash on June 12, 2008. Subsequent to July 31,
2011, 30,000,000 common shares were returned to the Company for cancellation,
leaving 80,000,000 common shares outstanding. (see also note 6) </P>
<P align=justify>NOTE 6 &#150; STOCK PAYABLE </P>
<P align=justify>At July 31, 2011 the Company has recorded a stock payable of
$1,146,950 (inclusive of interest of $59,547) owing for the development of its
website, internet presence and business systems. The amount was part of a
convertible line of credit agreement entered into by the Company February 2,
2011 whereby the Company received funds from a lender for approved expenditures
in the development of its business plan and includes interest of $59,547. Any
funds advanced to the Company pursuant to the convertible loan agreement were
unsecured, due in full February 2, 2016 and bear interest at 7.5% per annum. At
July 31, 2011 the loan has been converted to shares of common stock of the
Company on the basis of the higher of $0.75 per share or fair market value. The
Company evaluated the beneficial conversion feature of the line of credit for
derivative treatment and it was determined that, pursuant to the conversion
terms, there is no beneficial conversion feature or derivative value. Subsequent
to July 31, 2011 the Company issued 1,527,753 shares of common stock in
settlement of the conversion. </P>
<P align=justify>At July 31, 2011 an amount of $181,785 remained available to
the Company for draw down and is included in the $1,146,950 line of credit
converted to common shares. Subsequent to July 31, 2011 the $181,785 was
expended by the Company. At July 31, 2011 the $181,785 is recorded as Stock
Subscription Receivable. </P>

<P align=justify>MANAGEMENT&#146;S REPORT ON DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Management&#146;s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures
</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting as of July 31, 2011 using the criteria established in &#147;
Internal Control - Integrated Framework &#148; issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). </P>
<P align=justify>A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of
deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company&#146;s annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting as of July 31, 2011, the Company determined that there were control
deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. </P>

<P align=justify>We have adopted a new Code of Ethics that replaces our previous
version and applies to, among other persons, members of our board of directors,
our company's officers including our president, chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, employees, consultants and advisors.</P>
<P align=justify>We believe our Code of Ethics is reasonably designed to deter
wrongdoing and promote honest and ethical conduct; provide full, fair, accurate,
timely and understandable disclosure in public reports; comply with applicable
laws; ensure prompt internal reporting of code violations; and provide
accountability for adherence to the code. </P>
<P align=justify>Our Code of Ethics is attached as Exhibit 14.1 to this annual
report on Form 10-K. We will provide a copy of the Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics to any person without charge, upon request. Requests can be sent to:
Takedown Entertainment Inc., 22 Billiter Street, London, UK EC3M 2RY. </P>
<P align=justify>COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD</P>
<P align=justify>All proceedings of our board of directors were conducted by
resolutions consented to in writing by all the directors and filed with the
minutes of the proceedings of the directors. Such resolutions consented to in
writing by the directors entitled to vote on that resolution at a meeting of the
directors are, according to the corporate laws of the state of Nevada and the
bylaws of our company, as valid and effective as if they had been passed at a
meeting of the directors duly called and held.</P>
<P align=justify>Our audit committee consists of our entire board of directors.
</P>
<P align=justify>Our company currently does not have nominating, compensation
committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our company have
a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our board of
directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because
it believes that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by
our directors.</P>
<P align=justify>Our company does not have any defined policy or procedure
requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for
directors. The directors believe that, given the early stage of our development,
a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until
our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our company does not
currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to
the board of directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for
evaluating such nominees. Our directors assess all candidates, whether submitted
by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or
appointment.</P>

<P align=justify>A shareholder who wishes to communicate with our board of
directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President,
at the address appearing on the first page of this annual report.</P>
<P align=justify>AUDIT COMMITTEE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT</P>
<P align=justify>Our board of directors has determined that none of the members
of our audit committee qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as
defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and is "independent" as the
term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended.</P>
<P align=justify>We believe that the members of our board of directors are
collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and
understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We
believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an "audit
committee financial expert" would be overly costly and burdensome and is not
warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the
fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date. In addition, we
currently do not have nominating, compensation or audit committees or committees
performing similar functions nor do we have a written nominating, compensation
or audit committee charter. Our board of directors does not believe that it is
necessary to have such committees because it believes the functions of such
committees can be adequately performed by our board of directors.</P>

<P align=justify>This Code applies to the Chief Executive Officer, President,
Chief Financial Officer, Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial
Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Controller and persons performing similar
functions (collectively, the &#147;Senior Officers&#148;) along with all directors and
employees within the Corporation (the Senior Officers, directors and employees
are hereinafter collectively referred to as the &#147;Employees&#148;). This Code covers a
wide range of business practices and procedures. It does not cover every issue
that may arise, but it sets out basic principles to guide all Employees of the
Corporation. All Employees should conduct themselves accordingly and seek to
avoid the appearance of improper behaviour in any way relating to the
Corporation.</P>
<P align=justify>Any Employee who has any questions about the Code should
consult with the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Corporation&#146;s board
of directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) or the Corporation&#146;s audit committee (the &#147;Audit
Committee&#148;).</P>
<P align=justify>The Corporation has adopted the Code for the purpose of
promoting:</P>

<P align=justify><B>HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT</B></P>
<P align=justify>Each Senior Officer and member of the Board owes a duty to the
Corporation to act with integrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being
honest and candid. Employees must adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and are expected to make decisions and take actions based on the best interests
of the Corporation, as a whole, and not based on personal relationships or
benefits. Generally, a &#147;conflict of interest&#148; occurs when an Employee&#146;s personal
interests is, or appears to be, inconsistent with, interferes with or is opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation or gives the appearance of
impropriety.</P>

Corporation. Conflicts of interest can arise when an Employee or a member of his
or her family receive improper gifts, entertainment or benefits as a result of
his or her position in the Corporation.</P>

takes its public disclosure responsibility seriously to ensure that these

permitted by applicable law or regulation. Senior Officers involved in the

statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
consistently applied, and any other applicable accounting standards and rules so
that the financial statements materially, fairly and completely reflect the

<P align=justify><B>CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</B></P>
<P align=justify>Employees must maintain the confidentiality of confidential
information entrusted to them by the Corporation of its customers, suppliers,
joint venture partners, or others with whom the Corporation is considering a
business or other transaction except when disclosure is authorized by an
executive officer or required or mandated by laws or regulations. Confidential
information includes all non-public information that might be useful or helpful
to competitors or harmful to the Corporation or its customers or suppliers, if
disclosed. It also includes information that suppliers, customers and other
parties have entrusted to the Corporation. The obligation to preserve
confidential information continues even after employment ends.</P>

<P align=justify>Records containing personal data about employees or private
information about customers and their employees are confidential. They are to be
carefully safeguarded, kept current, relevant and accurate. They should be
disclosed only to authorized personnel or as required by law.</P>
<P align=justify>All inquiries regarding the Corporation from non-employees,
such as financial analysts and journalists, should be directed to the Board or
the Audit Committee. The Corporation&#146;s policy is to cooperate with every
reasonable request of government investigators for information. At the same
time, the Corporation is entitled to all the safeguards provided by law for the
benefit of persons under investigation or accused of wrongdoing, including legal
representation. If a representative of any government or government agency seeks
an interview or requests access to data or documents for the purposes of an
investigation, the Employee should refer the representative to the Board or the
Audit Committee. Employees also should preserve all materials, including
documents and e-mails that might relate to any pending or reasonably possible
investigation.</P>
<P align=justify><B>COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS</B></P>
<P align=justify>The Employees must respect and obey all applicable foreign,
federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations applicable to the business
and operations of the Corporation.</P>
<P align=justify>Employees who have access to, or knowledge of, material
nonpublic information from or about the Corporation are prohibited from buying,
selling or otherwise trading in the Corporation&#146;s stock or other securities.
&#147;Material nonpublic&#148; information includes any information, positive or negative,
that has not yet been made available or disclosed to the public and that might
be of significance to an investor, as part of the total mix of information, in
deciding whether to buy or sell stock or other securities.</P>
<P align=justify>Employees also are prohibited from giving &#147;tips&#148; on material
nonpublic information, that is directly or indirectly disclosing such
information to any other person, including family members, other relatives and
friends, so that they may trade in the Corporation&#146;s stock or other
securities.</P>
<P align=justify>Furthermore, if, during the course of an Employee&#146;s service
with the Corporation, he or she acquires material nonpublic information about
another company, such as one of our customers or suppliers, or you learn that
the Corporation is planning a major transaction with another company (such as an
acquisition), the Employee is restricted from trading in the securities of the
other company.</P>
<P align=justify><B>REPORTING ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE AND
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE</B></P>
<P align=justify>The Corporation, through the Board or the Audit Committee, is
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions may
arise and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.
This Code is not intended to provide a comprehensive guideline for Senior
Officers in relation to their business activities with the Corporation. Any
Employee may seek clarification on the application of this Code from the Board
or the Audit Committee.</P>

<P align=justify>The Board or the Audit Committee will take all action it
considers appropriate to investigate any breach of the Code reported to it. All
Employees are required to cooperate fully with any such investigations and to
provide truthful and accurate information. If the Board or the Audit Committee
determines that a breach has occurred, it will take or authorize disciplinary or
preventative action as it deems appropriate, after consultation with the
Corporation&#146;s counsel if warranted, up to and including termination of
employment. Where appropriate, the Corporation will not limit itself to
disciplinary action but may pursue legal action against the offending Employee
involved. In some cases, the Corporation may have a legal or ethical obligation
to call violations to the attention of appropriate enforcement authorities.</P>
<P align=justify>Compliance with the Code may be monitored by audits performed
by the Board, Audit Committee, the Corporation&#146;s counsel and/or by the
Corporation&#146;s outside auditors. All Employees are required to cooperate fully
with any such audits and to provide truthful and accurate information.</P>
<P align=justify>Any waiver of this Code for any Employee may be made only by
the Board or the Audit Committee and will be promptly disclosed to stockholders
and others, as required by applicable law. The Corporation must disclose changes
to and waivers of the Code in accordance with applicable law.</P>
